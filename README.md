Just In Case You Wondering About to Create an EFI Partition After Deleted it All for 
the Easier Option with Grub4Dos
	
Site Offering on Education and Share-er

One word on public domain
At Github, if I set any type of ownership rights license
And publish in public the free of cost mode for Github

That would mean all ownership rights are set that commercial use is allowed
While that is not a benefit for my worker 
I would like to be contacted somewhere with the Hitt counter result

While on the other hand rights
It hard to talker that any configuration of code
Be a mirror print of someone has done before

While I take the stance that my code might include somebody else works
And always credit due
That is another reason for using the public domain & license name unlicensed

If any work I included by another I will have their agenda about copyrights to Readme.txt

If it were set to nothing and then it would be copyright all over again
By way of not giving consent, I reckon

I did read all this about rights while starting here in Github

This was the best option after long reading somebody recommending Github
And wish somewhere to host code proper

Is only for education not making money
I get enjoyment from it and hope you as a hobbyist do
Or maybe benefit as long as you give me name sake credit learn

I shall look to include some large amount of visual basic 6 projects already got
When I get time another folder
This is my mainly text edited script folder 

Codes include
Include my camera reel roll up-loader
Which is quite nice and used a lot
None sync programs get you camera reel off-loader as nicely with date marking

And pin items to the taskbar for windows 10 another good one mine and another person 
main part code working

My code style is a bit of a sod with rem line do some explain
Many projects I use all the time and work perfectly

Nice to have Github to show off at last with an updater 
The site of my page is to show off my code to my contacts base mainly
I'm not really looker for code improvement by other people without asking

I'm a bit weak for coder at 50 nearly knocking on that door 1968
And had a broken clavicle bone from damage bike riding most of my learning 
I know it is a bleeding heart on the Internet 
And then what else do I talk

Took a While to Get Familiarize With GitHub Done Not Been Asleep and Allnighter

A Well Worth While Allnighter it was.
12 Hours Through the Night 1:30 Am to 1 pm
