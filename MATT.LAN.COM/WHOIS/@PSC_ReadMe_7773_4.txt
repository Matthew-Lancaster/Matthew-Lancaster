Title: _-~Who is looking at your site? v2.0!~-_
Description: Allows you to see the user sessions, times arrived and pages that each user is viewing on your website currently. Updated so now it deletes Application Variables, is in a zip file for easy deployment and also shows when a user first enters the site. PLEASE VOTE FOR THIS SCRIPT! Again, you have to love statistics... Otherwise don't bother :) Its a pain but if you need to know stats (like me) its worth it.
