<p>Almost immediately after arriving back in Petrograd, Kulik began thinking about the next and more important expedition into Siberia. Following his report to the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the inconclusive 1921 journey and during the next six years, he received further data from other investigators and additional eyewitness stories that made the explosion seem even more potent than he had imagined. These reports confirmed his belief that its epicenter, or fall point, lay north in the region of the Stony Tunguska; and he soon became convinced that a thorough survey of this area, preferably in the early spring when the weather would be at least tolerable, would uncover the true nature of the strange detonation and enable him to sort out fact from fiction in the numerous rumors circulating about the event.</p>

<p>Several other scientists who happened to be working in the Tunguska region gathered intriguing and sometimes frightening tales from the local inhabitants, the Tungus. S.V. Obruchev, a geologist conducting research along the Stony Tunguska River in the summer of 1924, encountered such superstitious awe among the natives about the blast, which he presumed had been caused by the impact of a large meteorite, that he wrote, "In the eyes of the Tungusi people, the meteorite is apparently sacred, and they carefully conceal the place where it fell." As Kulik was later to discover on his second Siberian journey, many Tungus were afraid to talk about the explosion and some completely denied its existence. Others reluctantly admitted to Obruchev only that a huge area of "flattened forest" could be found by traveling three or four days northeast of Vanavara to a wild and almost inaccessible part of the country near the Chambe and Khushmo rivers. Another local report sent to Kulik stated that, according to the Tungus, at least a thousand reindeer had been killed and several of their nomadic villages had vanished during the explosion. "A violent wind" had leveled the taiga, said others, and "water broke from the earth."</p>

<p>One of the most striking accounts of the effect of the explosion came from Ilya Potapovich, a Tungus who later became the chief guide for the 1927 expedition. Ilya Potapovich's harrowing story about his brother's experiences was recorded in 1923 and sent to Kulik by a geologist named Sobolev, who was working near the area:</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago his [Ilya Potapovich's] brother, who was a Tungus and could speak little Russian, lived on the River Chambe. One day a terrible explosion occurred, the force of which was so great that the forest was flattened for many versts along both banks of the River Chambe. His brother's hut was flattened to the ground, its roof was carried away by the wind, and most of his reindeer fled in fright. The noise deafened his brother and the shock caused him to suffer a long illness. In the flattened forest at one spot a pit was formed from which a stream flowed into the River Chambe. The Tunguska road had previously crossed his place, but it was now abandoned because it was blocked, impassable, and moreover the place aroused terror among the Tungusi people. From the Podkamennaya [Stony] Tunguska River to this place and back was a three-day journey by reindeer. As Ilya Potapovich told this story, he kept turning to his brother, who had endured all this. His brother grew animated, related something energetically in Tungusk language to Kartashov, striking the poles of his tent and the roof, and gesticulating in an attempt to show how his tent had been carried away.</p>

<p>According to the Tungus brother's widow, Akulina, who was questioned in 1926 by ethnographer I.M. Suslov, the en-tire family in the tent was thrown into the air and several knocked out by the explosion. The tent was approximately 25 miles southeast of the blast site. When Akulina and her husband woke up, Suslov reported, they saw "the forest blazing around them with many fallen trees. There was also a great noise." Suslov spoke to an elderly Tungus who had been sharing the tent with the family and recorded this story:</p>

<p>Vasily had been sleeping at the moment when the tent was tom away and had been thrown to the side by a powerful jolt. He had not lost consciousness. He said that he heard an unbelievably loud and continuous thunder; the ground shook, burning trees fell, and all around there was smoke and haze. Soon the thunder stopped, the wind ceased, but the forest continued to bum. All three of the Tungus went out to search for the reindeer which had run away during the catastrophe. But they were unable to find many of the reindeer.</p>

<p>As the eyewitness tales continued to pour in, it became apparent why the Tungus regarded the 1908 catastrophe as a divine punishment, the inexplicable wrath of a vengeful god. Suslov, who was studying the culture of the people of north-em and central Siberia and had established a rapport with the Tungus, constantly encountered tribesmen with horrifying tales of destruction. At Strelka, a tiny trading post on the Chunya River, he met the Tungus Podyga's children who had been living in a tent by the Avarkita River at the time of the explosion. "A terrible storm, so great that it was difficult to stand upright in it, blew down the trees near their hut," Suslov was told. "In the distant north, a large cloud formed which they thought was smoke."</p>

<p>At Strelka Suslov talked with a group of about sixty Tungus who agreed not only that the 1908 catastrophe had "crushed" the taiga, killing their animals and injuring some of their people, but also that the blast had "brought with it a disease for the reindeer, specifically scabs, that had never appeared before the fire came."</p>

<p>The 1908 fireball's direction of flight and the probable location of the blast had been estimated in the mid-1920s by A. V. Voznesensky, former head of the Irkutsk Observatory. Using some of the recent information acquired by Kulik and Obruchev, as well as earlier seismic data from Irkutsk and other Russian stations and observations of acoustical phenomena throughout central Siberia, he attempted to trace the path of the body and determine its impact point He found that the effects of the explosion had been seen and heard by people over an incredibly immense geographical area, one larger than France and Germany combined. The "fiery object" racing through the cloudless sky had been observed by thousands from the southern border of Siberia to the Tunguska region, while the noise of the explosion, the heavy claps, and rumblings "like thunder" were audible for a radius of 500 miles. From these reports and the seismic data, he was able to gauge the time of the blast at about 7:17 A.M. on June 30, 1908. The place of the fall, he determined, was in the territory north of Vanavara.</p>

<p>Voznesensky speculated that the explosion was caused not by a single meteorite but rather by a group which "were flying in the same direction and gradually breaking up." The tremendous aerial waves were caused as the "fragmentations of the meteorite" expended their energy over central Siberia, and the blast and ground vibrations were caused by "a very considerable mass that fell on to the ground." Convinced that a future expedition would discover in the Tunguska region a gigantic impact hole similar to Arizona's Meteor Crater, Voznesensky concluded that:</p>

<p>... it is highly probable that the future investigator of the spot where the Khatanga [Stony Tunguska] meteorite fell will find something very similar to the meteorite crater of Arizona; i.e., from 2 to 3 kilometers around he will find a mass of fragments that were separated from the main nucleus before it fell and during its fall. The Indians of Arizona still preserve the legend that their ancestors saw a fiery chariot fall from the sky and penetrate the ground at the spot where the crater is; the present-day Tungusi people have a similar legend about a new fiery stone. This stone they stubbornly refused to show to the interested Russians who were investigating the matter in 1908. However that may be, the search for and investigation of the Khatanga meteorite could prove a very profitable subject of study, particularly if this meteorite turned out to belong to the iron class.</p>

<p>The detailed eyewitness testimony gathered by Obruchev and Suslov and the calculations of Voznesensky were helpful to Kulik in persuading the Soviet Academy, despite the fact that many of its members remained unconvinced that the earlier evidence indicated a meteorite, to authorize the first expedition to the Stony Tunguska River basin. Thus, in February 1927, Kulik departed from Leningrad (as Petrograd was renamed in 1924) with a research assistant and traveled by Trans-Siberian Express to Kansk and then farther east to the remote station of Taishet In each of these small outposts he met more people who agreed on the northward direction of the "ball of fire" and who had heard the "prolonged thunder" of its explosion. In Kansk, 375 miles southwest of the Stony Tunguska area, persons in the streets had "felt a subterranean rumble. Inside, hanging objects were noticed to rock, china was smashed, and in one house the inside wooden shutters rattled."</p>

<p>Other reports from the Kansk district told of boatmen being thrown into the river and horses knocked down by the force of the thunder and the ground tremors. At Taishet, about a hundred miles farther along the railway line, buildings and telegraph poles shook, doors banged in houses, and objects fell to tie floor.</p>

<p>In March, after gathering supplies and equipment, Kulik and his assistant began their journey northward from Taishet toward the presumed fall point. Even this far into spring, central Siberia was one of the least comfortable places on earth, but Kulik had little choice about the schedule. If he had come earlier, snow would have made the region impassable. By mid-summer, much of the taiga turned to marsh where clouds of mosquitoes tormented men and animals. But in March, with the ground still firm under a light cover of snow, it was possible to move through the area, although occasional storms reducing temperatures to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit could make any expedition an endurance test</p>

<p>Kulik and his assistant traveled by horse-drawn sled along the Angara River to Keshma, a small village where they purchased more food and supplies. The country soon became more rugged, split with creeks, gullies, and steep hillsides. The high latitude confused their compasses. Maps were inaccurate, where they existed at all. Finally, near the end of March, they arrived at Vanavara on the Stony Tunguska River. The last stop before proceeding into the vast taiga, the tiny settlement consisted only of a few houses, trading stores, and muddy streets. Kulik hired Ilya Potapovich, the Tungus, as his guide and with his assistance began questioning local residents about the explosion.</p>

<p>From several inhabitants of Vanavara Kulik obtained remarkable stories of the blast, particularly of the searing heat and the shock waves. On the morning of June 30, 1908, S.B. Semenov, a farmer, had been sitting on the open porch of his house, looking toward the north when suddenly he saw a "great flash of light" above the northwestern horizon. He wrote of the event:</p>

<p>There was so much heat that I was no longer able to remain where I was - my shirt almost burned off my back. I saw a huge fireball that covered an enormous part of the sky. I only had a moment to note the size of it. Afterward it became dark and at the same time I felt an explosion that threw me several feet from the porch. I lost consciousness for a few moments and when I came to I heard a noise that shook the whole house and nearly moved it off its foundation. The glass and the framing of the house shattered and in the middle of the area where the hut stands a strip of ground split apart.</p>

<p>At the same time a neighbor, P.P. Kosolapov, who had been working outside by the window of the house, felt his ears burned as if by a "powerful heat." He put his hands over his ears and asked Semenov whether he had seen anything. "How could one help but see it?" Semenov replied. "I felt as though I had been seized by the heat." Kosolapov went inside the house when abruptly "there was a great clap of thunder and the sod poured from the ceiling, a door flew off the Russian stove, and a piece of window glass fell into the room." Although Kulik had never heard of such heat phenomena associated with a meteorite fall, he believed that this could be accounted for by the meteorite's size and the release of energy in its collision with the earth. He was wrong, but at this time neither he nor any other scientists had sufficient knowledge to explain this type of radiant burning.</p>

<p>Like earlier investigators, Kulik also found that some Tungus preferred not to discuss the event. A few were openly hostile. Gradually he learned the details of a new religion that had sprung up among some inhabitants of the taiga since the explosion, one which made the Tungus unwilling to help anyone approach the fall site. The fiery body, they claimed, was a visitation from the god Ogdy (Fire), who had cursed the area by smashing the trees and killing all the animals. No man dared approach the fall site for fear of being cursed by Ogdy's fire. Tales circulated of herds of reindeer being slaughtered to placate the god and of rumors that Ogdy, enraged at invasions of his territory, would hold back the thaw if visitors disturbed him.</p>

<p>These stories only made Kulik more anxious to see the blast area for himself. On the day after arriving in Vanavara, he and Ilya Potapovich tried to ride on horseback into the taiga but were unable to make any progress because of an unusually deep snowfall. Roads into the forest were nonexistent. They returned to Vanavara, where Kulik continued interviewing the local people and preparing for the trek into the wilderness. Then, on April 8, Kulik, his assistant, and Ilya Potapovich set out with pack horses along the winding path of the Stony Tunguska River. By the time they reached the hut of Okhchen, a friendly Tungus, on the Chambe River, all were exhausted, suffering from scurvy brought on by the lack of proper food and from infections caused by pestilential marsh over which they had to move. Kulik and his colleague had never endured such hardship, but the belief that they were almost at the end of their journey gave them the energy to keep going.</p>

<p>&nbsp;From the Tungus they learned that they were close to the beginning of the devastated forest, the edge of the blast area. After resting for one night, they loaded their equipment onto reindeer and set off along the bank of the Chambe', then left the river and proceeded directly north. Within two days, they crossed the Makirta River which flows into the Chambe. It Was April 13. At the edge of the Makirta the small expeditionary party stared at an incredible sight: the first signs of the enormous force of the 1908 explosion.</p>
