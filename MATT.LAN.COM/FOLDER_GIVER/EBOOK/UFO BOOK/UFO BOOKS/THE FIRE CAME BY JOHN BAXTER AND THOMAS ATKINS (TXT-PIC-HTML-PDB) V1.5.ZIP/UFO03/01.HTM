<p>High above the Indian Ocean, a huge object hurtling from space pierces the earth's atmospheric shell. In the almost airless upper altitudes, there is no sound, barely any friction; unimpeded, it races toward the earth.</p>

<p>In a long sloping trajectory, it rockets northwards at supersonic velocity across the Asian mainland, high over the Himalayan peaks. Drawn lower by gravity, it hits the thicker strata of the globe's atmosphere. Intense frictional heat begins to build up.</p>

<p>It first flashes into the sight of man over western China in the dawn of June 30, 1908. Caravans winding through the Gobi Desert halt and look in awe at a fireball blazing across the sky. It disappears over the border of Mongolia. Plunging into the denser air layers, it glows with the heat of 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, brighter even than the thin morning sun.</p>

<p>In central Russia, a deafening roar terrifies the inhabitants of small towns and villages, the only settlements in this remote and deserted area. A powerful ballistic wave pushed before the descending object strikes the ground. Trees are leveled, nomad huts blown down, men and animals scattered like specks of dust.</p>

<p>At 7:17 A.M. the Central Siberian Plateau near the Stony Tunguska River, a sparsely populated, desolate region of peat bogs and pine forests, shudders under the impact of a cataclysmic explosion.</p>

<p>The detonation is of such violent force that the seismographic center at Irkutsk, 550 miles to the south, registers tremors of earthquake proportions. Vibrations travel 3,000 miles through the ground to other stations in Moscow and the capital of the tsarist empire, St Petersburg; and the earthquake observatory at Jena, Germany, 3,240 miles away, records strong seismic shocks. Even as far away as Washington and Java seismographs are activated by the immense blast</p>

<p>Instantly, a gigantic "pillar of fire" flares up into the clear blue sky, ascending to such height that the blinding column is visible above the horizon to startled Siberians in towns several hundred miles away; then the air is wracked by a series of thunderous claps that can be heard for more than 500 miles. The noise is so great that some herdsmen closer to the blast are deafened; others are thrown into a state of dazed shock that renders them speechless.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the brilliant fire in the sky, a searing thermal current sweeps across the hilly taiga, or northern woods, scorching the tall conifers and igniting fires that will continue to burn for days. Stunned citizens 40 miles away in the trading post of Vanavara shield their faces from the fierce heat draft. Seconds later, a shock wave generated by the blast rips through the small village, gouging up pieces of sod, collapsing ceilings, shattering windows, and flinging people into the air.</p>

<p>At a distance of 375 miles to the south-southwest, hurricane like gusts rattle doors, windows, and lamps in Kansk, a station town on the newly completed Trans-Siberian Railway. Within minutes two additional waves of shock strike the town. People working nearby on rafts are hurled into the river, while farther south, horses stumble and fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Near Kansk, aboard the Trans-Siberian Express, passengers are frightened by loud bursts of noise and almost jolted out of their seats. The train is jarred and shakes wildly on its tracks. As the startled engineer sees the rails ahead vibrating, he quickly brings the train to a screeching halt. Eventually, when the ground upheavals subside, the locomotive proceeds to the nearest station where the engineer and a station agent make sure that the travelers are unharmed and inspect the whole train to see whether any of the freight has been damaged.</p>

<p>As dark masses of thick clouds rise to an altitude of more than 12 miles above the Tunguska region, the entire area is showered by an ominous "black rain," the result of sudden air condensation and the fountain of dirt particles and debris sucked up into the swirling vortex of the explosion. Intermittent rumblings of thunder, resembling heavy artillery, reverberate throughout central Russia.</p>

<p>Far across the continent to the west in St. Petersburg, no one hears of the blast, nor will anybody hear of it for many years. The record of seismic shocks, when they are noticed, will at first be mistaken for earthquake tremors. In 1908 most Russians have their minds on other problems, for their country is gripped by social unrest and political tension that eventually will erupt in the Revolution. From his imperial capital, an elegant city whose cultural closeness to Europe emphasizes the government's detachment from its own citizens' troubles, Tsar Nicholas II maintains a precarious hold on a nation divided and, in many cases, desperate.</p>

<p>To avert the threat of revolution in 1905, Nicholas reluctantly agreed to the formation of Russia's first parliament, the Duma; and the elections of 1907 had brought in many Social Democrats and veterans of earlier revolutions against tsarist autocracy. For the first time, Russia has labor unions - though they lack the power to strike - and a moderately free press. But the universities in particular remain dissatisfied; among the men whose revolutionary activities at this time will land them in jail is a young forestry student named Leonid Kulik, who is to become a central figure in the solution of the Tunguska mystery.</p>

<p>To many students, the new Duma seems as uninterested in Russia's problems as are the councils of the Tsar. Throughout June and July of 1908, the news in St. Petersburg is not of catastrophes such as the Tunguska explosion - which is mentioned only in local Siberian papers - but of events like a duel fought between two Duma members over a matter of political disagreement. The relocation of Russia's capital from St. Petersburg to Moscow does not take place until 1918; meanwhile, the government remains isolated and indifferent to the disasters and mysteries of its vast, unknown country in the east.</p>

<p>The appalling misery of this oppressed land as well as its sense of mystery and promise are evoked by Nikolai Gogol in his tragicomic masterpiece Dead Souls. Describing a trip taken by his hero Chichikov through the Russian steppes, he writes: "I see you: a country of dinginess, and bleakness and dispersal. ... So what is the incomprehensible secret force driving me toward you? Why do I constantly hear the echo of your mournful song as it is carried from sea to sea through your entire expanse? ... And since you are without end yourself, is it not within you that a boundless thought will be born?"</p>

<p>In 1908, across the Pacific, in the United States, where Teddy Roosevelt is serving the final year of his second term as President, few people pay attention to the upheavals occurring in the Tsar's distant country. No word of the Siberian explosion has yet reached the United States. Instead, Americans are watching the appearance of several new machines that soon will revolutionize transportation, communication, and warfare throughout the world. Businessman Henry Ford has just released his Model T, the first mass-produced automobile; within less than two decades twenty-five million of these vehicles will be swarming across the American landscape.</p>

<p>The United States War Department, after dropping his initial letter in the "crank" file, finally decides to give inventor Orville Wright a contract to build the first military airplane. In August his brother Wilbur amazes the French press by doing a figure eight in his flying machine and staying aloft for 107 seconds at Hunaudieres racecourse; and by September, at Fort Myer, Virginia, Orville manages to keep his machine in the air for one hour and five minutes. Two years later the United States Government conducts the first experiments in aerial bombing.</p>

<p>Around the world, scientists armed with the latest inventions of nineteenth-century technology are struggling to interpret the universe to the newly
born twentieth century. Astronomers, observing the solar system and our galaxy through increasingly powerful telescopes, have gathered fresh and often puzzling information about the behavior of remote stars and other cosmic phenomena. In 1908 the cosmos is still regarded as basically stable and unchanging; its "edge" is thought to be the Milky Way, which has not yet been fully mapped.</p>

<p>Meteorological instruments, though still relatively primitive, are used to explore the intricate relationship between solar flares and the earth's magnetic fields, but without a solid understanding of nuclear physics such readings cannot be fully analyzed. At this time Robert Millikan is doing his ground-breaking work on X-rays, and the "ether" theory of space has just been overturned. Albert Einstein will soon radically change scientific notions of space, time, and matter with his general relativity theory. The neutron has not yet been discovered by James Chadwick. The Nobel Prize in chemistry for 1908 is awarded to Ernest Rutherford for his pioneer studies of radioactivity; he will shortly formulate his atomic nucleus idea that is to become one of the fundamental concepts of modern physics.</p>

<p>The year 1908, in retrospect, seems to be a time of strange and inexplicable events, a period when people claim to see peculiar moving lights at night or captains report "magnetic clouds" descending on their ships. "Alien airships" are seen racing at fantastic speeds over the United States and Europe. That summer a "200-foot-long sea serpent" rises from the Gulf of Mexico off the Yucatan Peninsula and is described in great detail by passengers on a steamship.</p>

<p>Scientists watching the sky in 1908 are prepared for new occurrences, yet poorly equipped to identify or interpret them - particularly one as unprecedented and complex as the event near the Stony Tunguska River.</p>

<p>Though news of the explosion has not appeared in the American or European press and scientists in the West as yet know nothing of the event, the papers during the summer of 1908 are full of speculation about the unusual meteorological phenomena and magnetic disturbances that follow the devastating blast. A report from Berlin in the New York Times of July 3 attempts to explain the bizarre colors seen recently in the Northern Lights:</p>

<p>Remarkable lights were observed in the northern heavens on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the bright diffused white and yellow illumination continuing through the night until it disappears at dawn. Director Archenbold of the Treptow Observatory says that because of the phenomenon's particular brilliancy he thinks it may be connected with important changes in the sun's surface, causing electrical discharges. Director Archenbold, however, mentions a somewhat similar phenomena in 1883, which was directly traceable to an outbreak of the Krakatoa volcano in the Strait of Sundy [Sunda]. Reports from Copenhagen and Konigsberg told of the same great lights being visible in these cities, and it is presumed that they were visible throughout Northern Europe. </p>

<p>But the 1883 eruption in the East Indies is similar only in its vast size and strength; the 1908 Siberian explosion is not volcanic, and the time scale and physical characteristics of the phenomena resulting from the event are utterly different - and ultimately far more frightening and mysterious - than those that followed Krakatoa.</p>

<p>Unusual atmospheric charges prompt speculation in England the evening after the explosion. "There was a slight, but plainly marked, disturbance of the magnets on Tuesday night," states an editorial in the Times of London; but this magnetic interference is at first mistakenly associated with "disturbances in the sun's prominences" rather than with the Siberian catastrophe, which has not been reported in British newspapers at the time.</p>

<p>Within five hours of the blast, turbulent air waves travel west beyond the North Sea, causing strong oscillations at meteorological stations in England. During a span of twenty minutes, sudden fluctuations in atmospheric pressure are detected by recently invented self-recording barographs at six stations between Cambridge, 50 miles north of London, and Petersfield, 55 miles south. Baffled weather researchers assume that a large atmospheric disturbance has occurred somewhere in the world; but not until two decades later, after the first news of the devastation in the Tunguska region finally reaches the English press, do they discover that their 1908 barographic records correspond with the astonishing Russian explosion of that same year and that its air waves circled the globe twice. </p>

<p>But perhaps even more striking than the unexplained effects on the earth's magnetic fields and the powerful air waves associated with the blast is the appearance at high altitudes of massive luminous "silvery clouds" blanketing Siberia and northern Europe. The light is so intense during the next few nights that in some places it is possible to take photographs at midnight and ships can be seen clearly for miles out at sea. A Russian scientist describes the thick layer of glowing clouds as lit up by "some kind of yellowish-green light that sometimes changed to a rosy hue." He adds, "It was the first time I had seen such a phenomenon."</p>

<p>Extraordinary dust clouds and eerie nocturnal displays, moreover, are observed for weeks across the Continent as far south as Spain. On June 30, the day of the explosion, a scientist in Holland sees "an undulating mass" passing across the northwest horizon. "It was not cloud," he states, "for the blue sky itself seemed to undulate." That same evening an astronomer in Heidelberg finds that when he tries to photograph the stars, his plates are fogged by the abnormal luminosity in the sky. After sunset in Antwerp the northern horizon appears to be on fire.</p>

<p>In 1930, in the Royal Meteorological Society Quarterly Journal, Spenser Russell gives an account of the odd colors he observed over England in 1908 on the nights of June 30 and July 1:</p>

<p>A strong orange-yellow light became visible in the north and northeast ... causing an undue prolongation of twilight lasting to daybreak on July 1st, when the eastern sky was an intense green to yellow-gold hue. ... The entire northern sky on these two nights, from the horizon to an altitude of 40&ordm;, was of a suffused red hue varying from pink to an intense crimson. There was a complete absence of scintillation or flickering, and no tendency for the formation of streamers, or a luminous arch, characteristic of auroral phenomena. ... Twilight on both of these nights was prolonged to daybreak, and there was no real darkness. ... The phenomenon was reported from various places in the United Kingdom and on the Continent, from Copenhagen, Konigsberg, Berlin, and Vienna.</p>

<p>According to the London Times of July 4, 1908, "The remarkable ruddy glows which have been seen on many nights lately have attracted much attention, and have been seen over an area extending as far as Berlin." The cause is assigned to "some condition of the atmosphere," such as occurred after Krakatoa, although "no volcanic outburst of abnormal violence has been reported lately." The Times notes that the recent "abnormal" glows appear in the sky only after the fading of twilight: the sky grows partially dark and then brightens again with "deep, lurid color."</p>

<p>On July 5, in a New York Times report from Britain entitled "Like Dawn at Midnight," a correspondent writes:</p>

<p>Following sunsets of exceptional beauty and twilight effects remarkable even in England, the northern sky at midnight became light blue, as if the dawn were breaking, and the clouds were touched with pink in so marked a fashion that police headquarters was rung up by several people who believed that a big fire was raging in the north of London.</p>

<p>In the London suburbs citizens are drawn into the streets to view the frightening cosmic phenomenon. A woman in Huntingdon, north of London, alarmed by the vivid night lights, writes to the London Times that shortly after midnight on July i the sky was so bright that "it was possible to read large print indoors, and the hands of the clock in my room were quite distinct An hour later, at about 1:30 A.M., the room was quite light as if it had been day; the light in the sky was then more dispersed and was a fainter yellow." She concludes, "I have never at any time seen anything the least like this in England, and it would be interesting if anyone would explain the cause of so unusual a sight"</p>

<p>But no satisfactory explanation is offered to the woman's question. The silence about the nature of the incredible nightly spectacles seen over Europe and the riddle of the great Siberian explosion is not broken for more than a decade.</p>
