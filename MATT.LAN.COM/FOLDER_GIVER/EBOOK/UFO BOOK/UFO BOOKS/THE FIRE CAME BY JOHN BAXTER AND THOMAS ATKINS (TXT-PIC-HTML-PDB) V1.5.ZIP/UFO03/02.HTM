<p>Human history is marked indelibly with the destruction caused by great explosions.</p>

<p>In about 1500 B.C. most of the island of Thera (later called Santorini) in the Aegean, 70 miles north of Crete, disappeared in a blast which reduced a fertile kingdom to little more than a splintered shell. Today, one can see the crescent rim of the dead volcano and two blackened, still-active islets in the center of a 16-mile-wide lagoon where once stood an important center of Aegean culture. Sheer cliffs plunging a thousand feet into the dark water, their sides striped with the brilliant colors of blistered rock, attest to the force of the blast.</p>

<p>Tidal waves from the explosion swept across 70 miles of sea to Crete, rolling over the palaces and temples, crushing the fragile frescoes and pillared colonnades of a society among the most enlightened in the world. Recent excavations on Thera have uncovered wall paintings of unexampled color and delicacy, as well as signs of a thriving and sophisticated community - discoveries which lend weight to the theory that in the sudden destruction of Thera and the related Cretan empire may lie the beginnings of the legend of Atlantis.</p>

<p>No similar catastrophe affected history until A.D. 62, when an earthquake caused by the eruption of Vesuvius toppled much of the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum near Naples. Many of the houses had not been rebuilt seventeen years later when, on August 24, A.D. 79, Vesuvius erupted once more; in two days, both towns were inundated with hot ash, small stones, and lava as deep in some places as 23 feet. In Herculaneum, water mixed with this debris to create an impermeable plaster-like covering which has been gradually cleared by archaeologists in the last three centuries to reveal, frozen in time, the life of a busy Roman town.</p>

<p>The Vesuvius blast was dwarfed by what experts generally agreed to be the greatest natural explosion of modern times, the destruction of the volcanic island of Krakatoa between Java and Sumatra. Krakatoa, which had erupted intermittently for centuries, shuddered into life again in May of 1883. More eruptions were felt during June and August. On the early afternoon of August 26, the volcano began to explode, eventually discharging a 17-mile-high cloud of dark ash; and at 10 A.M. on the following morning the whole island was shaken by a cataclysmic blast Ash fountained 50 miles into the sky. Air waves from the explosion registered all over the world, and the sound was heard 2,200 miles away in Australia. Five cubic miles of rock disappeared, some falling back as stones and ash on the surrounding islands and clogging the waters so badly that nearby ships were unable to move through the debris.</p>

<p>Tidal waves more than a hundred feet high smashed into the Java and Sumatra coasts, killing 36,000 people; the same waves registered on the coasts of South America and Hawaii. For several days, darkness masked the area around the volcano. Thrown into the higher atmosphere by the enormous force of the blast, tons of dust were carried around the world a number of times by the high-velocity winds - 55 to 110 miles per hour - of the stratosphere between 12 and 25 miles above the earth. The dust so saturated the upper air that sunsets all over the world carried a noticeable bloody tinge for more than twelve months and interference with solar radiation lowered the world temperature 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit for many years.</p>

<p>For all their enormous size, destructive capability, and long-term effects, node of these explosions could surpass the sheer force of the Tunguska blast in 1908. Its size, as registered on seismographs and barographs in Europe, deserves comparison only with the greater man-made explosions of the atomic age; even the Hiroshima blast and the nuclear tests of the early 1950s are dwarfed by it. Authorities in the U.S.S.R., Britain, and the U.S.A. agree that the estimated energy output of the Siberian blast - 10&lt;23&gt; ergs - would be comparable only with the explosion of the heaviest hydrogen bombs.</p>

<p>Today, the failure at the time to investigate the Tunguska explosion seems at first incredible; a cataclysm greater than any the world had ever known went without serious inquiry or comment for thirteen years and even then was discovered only by the most remarkable series of coincidental events and the stubborn efforts of one man. But, for numerous reasons, the vast silence of 1908 to 1921 is understandable.</p>

<p>Most catastrophes in human history have gone, by modem standards of communication, largely unrecorded; and the fact that the Tunguska explosion went unexplored for such a long period is not unusual. Chiefly because they were volcanic, the explosions of Thera, Vesuvius, and Krakatoa happen to be exceptionally well documented.</p>

<p>Volcanoes attract attention. In general, they herald their major eruptions with a fanfare of minor tremors, emissions of smoke, and showers of ash and leave behind, as in the case of all three major explosions, a wealth of geological evidence which, even on the island of Thera, can still be read thousands of years later. In addition, because volcanic ash provides the basis for rich and fertile soil, most volcanoes are surrounded by thriving communities and thus a generous corps of observers. Krakatoa had not been still for five years after the 1883 eruption, in fact, before a community was again springing up on its slopes. Thera today supports 9,000 people and has thriving vineyards.</p>

<p>By contrast, some disasters of even greater force, because of their special nature, lack even a fraction of the evidence of Krakatoa or Thera. Many aspects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic explosions remain obscure because of a lack of trained witnesses, while, as William Manchester points out in The Glory and the Dream, the details of the damage wrought by the great hurricane which shattered Long Island and New England in September, 1938, leaving about 700 dead and 1,754 injured, went largely unreported, the news being partly eclipsed by the Munich crisis and Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>Meteorite explosions, among which the Tunguska blast was initially categorized, have proved even less easy to document. Without giving any of the warning signs shown by a volcano, meteorites come rushing in at cosmic velocity - as fast as 25 miles per second - and, should they happen to reach the earth, it is often in a remote area; examples of meteorites injuring people or property in populated areas are extremely rare. Evidence of their trajectory and impact is often confused or inaccurate; and if they fell in the distant past, records may be dim or totally nonexistent. The collisions which created the huge craters in Arizona and Quebec occurred from ten to fifty thousand years ago, and the actual impact holes remain as the primary evidence.</p>

<p>In the case of the Tunguska blast, its discovery and documentation were complicated by the nature of the terrain where the event occurred. The very name "Siberia" derives from a Tartar word meaning "sleeping land." The vast central region lying east of the Yenisei River was, and still is in many ways, one of the most remote places on the face of the earth. Had the area been picked out as the location for such an event, it could not have been more secret. Significantly, when the Soviet government chose a place to explode its first atomic bomb in 1946, it was to Siberia and the frozen tundra above the Arctic Circle that it looked for a test site.</p>

<p>Kansk, one of the main railroad towns nearest to the explosion, is 2,500 miles from Moscow and 3,000 from St. Petersburg, the national capital in 1908 - a distance as great as from New York City to Los Angeles. Before the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway, travelers on foot took as long as a year to make the journey from St. Petersburg to Irkutsk; and for most Russians at the turn of the century Siberia remained an area as foreign and distant as the moon. Besides the local fanners and fishermen, many of its inhabitants were political prisoners or their descendants; generations of dissidents had been shipped to centers like Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk, forced to slave in the mines and forests, then had been abandoned there by a government which knew they had no choice but to settle and farm. Both Lenin and Trotsky served sentences in Siberia; in 1908 the political prisoners in the area almost certainly included Josef Stalin, who was sentenced to six different terms between 1903 and 1913.</p>

<p>From April to July of 1890, the Russian writer Anton Chekhov made an incredible trip from Moscow, chiefly by horse carriage and river boat, across the entire breadth of Siberia to Sakhalin, an island off the Pacific coast used by the Tsar as a penal colony. In his letters Chekhov provides vivid impressions of the Siberian climate, landscape, and people. In May, near Tomsk he wrote:</p>

<p>Spring hasn't yet arrived here. There is absolutely no greenery, the forests are bare, the snow has not all melted and lusterless ice sheathes the lakes. On the ninth of May, St Nicholas Day, there was a frost, and today, the fourteenth, we had a snowfall of about three inches. Only the ducks hint of spring. ... I have never in my life seen such a superabundance of ducks. ... You can hear the wild geese honking. ... Often files of cranes and swans head our way. ... Well, you go on and on. Road signs flash by, ponds, little birch groves. ... Now we drive past a group of new settlers, then a file of prisoners. ... We've met tramps with pots on their backs; these gentlemen promenade all over the Siberian plain without hindrance. On occasion they will murder a poor old woman to obtain her skirt for leg puttees [wrappings] ... but they won't touch people in vehicles.</p>

<p>Although Chekhov praised the Siberians in general as good, honest people, he confessed that he did not find the women attractive. "Siberian women and misses," he remarked, "are frozen fish. You'd have to be a walrus or seal to have an affair with them." After having journeyed the 800 miles from Tomsk to Irkutsk, he commented: "The Siberian highways have their scurvy little stations, like the Ukraine. They pop up every 20 or 25 miles. You drive at night, on and on, until you feel giddy and ill, but you keep on going, and if you venture to ask the driver how many miles it is to the next station, he invariably says not less than twelve." On the way to Irkutsk Chekhov had stopped at Krasnoyarsk, caught a boat across the Yenisei, which he described as the "fierce and mighty warrior" of rivers, and then admired the mysterious and seemingly boundless taiga of central Siberia.</p>

<p>Though it covers a vast area, larger than Alaska, central Siberia has a relatively sparse population of only a few hundred thousand. Its migrating tribesmen, the Tungus (a Mongoloid people, later renamed Evenki by the Soviets), traversed only the areas best for trapping, so huge sections of the taiga were still unexplored. An American prospector of the early 1900s wrote of the difficulties of the Siberian taiga: "I had a terrible journey through forests and over mountains, where rain fell incessantly and I nearly died through exhaustion. The valleys, hillsides, in fact everywhere we went, was covered with bog made by the falling pine-needles through countless ages. The horses plunged on for miles in this stuff up to their knees."</p>

<p>Distances here were given in terms of "summer" or "winter," those for winter being much shorter, since the snow enabled sleds to cross areas impassable during the brief thaw. Roads in the European sense were unknown; the trappers followed tracks worn by generations of foxes and hares and seldom imitated the foolish foreigners who, searching for Siberia's enormous gold and mineral wealth, struck out into the wilderness. In such places, distance and time had little relevance, as investigators found when they tried to piece together eyewitness reports of the 1908 event - another factor contributing to the silence that surrounded the explosion.</p>

<p>Within central Siberia, the region of the Podkamennaya Tunguska, or Stony Tunguska, River is even more impenetrable. One of the many streams that drain north into the huge Yenisei, which in turn feeds the Arctic Ocean, the Stony Tunguska rises in a mountainous wilderness of rolling taiga spotted with huge swamps. The taiga in this region is no ordinary woodland but, as Yuri Semyonov points out in his study of Siberia, a "vast and sinister" primeval forest in which "the weak and imprudent often perish" in its trackless depths and pathless bogs where "everything below is decayed and rotten, and everything above withered, where only the corpses of the huge trunks slowly moulder away in the brackish water."</p>

<p>Its chief inhabitants, the nomadic Tungus, survived mainly on their reindeer herds and on hunting other animals - such as bear, fox, and sable - for their pelts. The few trading posts, situated along the riverbanks, were tiny and primitive. The Tunguska blast occurred during the height of the short summer, when the soil of the taiga melts to a swampy slush and the air is infested with ferocious Siberian mosquito's. The winter frosts of the area, which lies about 300 miles below the Arctic Circle, can be so terrible that, according to Semyonov, birds drop from the air as if dead and freeze immediately unless taken inside for warmth.</p>

<p>In addition to its remoteness and inhospitable climate, central Siberia had an atmosphere of ancient mystery and an accumulation of inexplicable phenomena. For centuries, the country around the Stony Tunguska had been gathering its share of strange stories and legends: weird species of fish existing in the depths of Lake Baikal, giant subterranean rats living beneath the ground, monstrous mammals encased in icy tombs. The explosion of 1908, just one more in a series of curiosities, must have seemed to some natives, and later to people in Moscow and St Petersburg, hardly worth the trouble of comment.</p>

<p>This is the home of the "Siberian disease," or "Arctic hysteria." Historian Emil Lengyel wrote: "It is mimicry mania. The victim repeats whatever he hears or sees. Sometimes he repeats words he does not even understand or repeats animal sounds, such as barking. This malady also takes other forms. At village dances, it sometimes happens that the rhythm becomes too strong to resist and the dancers cannot stop. The hysteria becomes infectious and even old people are caught in the swirling emotion and dance until exhaustion makes them collapse." Political prisoners often succumbed to the disease; a German officer sent to Siberia as a prisoner of war in 1918 repeated the word "dismal" constantly in a dozen languages, while another mumbled the phrase "Life is death and death is life" over and over again until taken to the camp psychopathic ward.</p>

<p>To the southeast of the Tunguska region lies Lake Baikal, one of the most unusual bodies of water in the world. Lying across a fault in the earth's crust, the Lake Baikal area has been riven by earthquakes for millennia; the large number of shocks in the late nineteenth century obviously influenced scientists at first to class the 1908 explosion as seismic. Millions of years ago the plates on which this section of Asia is balanced ground against one another, throwing up massive mountain ranges and forming a fissure, as the plates resolidified, more than a thousand miles long, thirty to forty miles wide, and several miles deep. Normally, such gaps are filled quickly with molten material, but this one failed to close up completely and over thousands of years a 400-mile-long rift filled with fresh water to become Baikal.</p>

<p>Departing from Irkutsk for the final stretch of his trip to Sakhalin, Chekhov crossed the "astonishing" Lake Baikal. "It is with good cause that the Siberians entitle it not a lake, but a sea," he wrote in a letter of June 20, 1890. "The water is unusually limpid, so that you can see through it as you do through air; its color is tenderly turquoise, pleasant to the eye. The shores are mountainous and wooded; all about are impenetrable, sunless thickets. There is an abundance of bears, sable, wild goats, and all kinds of wild game, which occupies itself in existing in the taiga and making meals of one another."</p>

<p>Baikal is the largest body of fresh water in the world, a mile deep in some places, and harboring some of the oddest creatures known to science; of the 1,800 plants and animals in its waters, a thousand exist nowhere else on earth. Seals and fish normally found only in salt water live comfortably there, hundreds of miles from the nearest ocean; and Baikal is the only home of fish like the golomyanka, which lives at depths that can crush a steel tube. "It is hardly ever seen alive," remarked the Western traveler Bassett Digby in the late 1920s. "The shock of the inshore breakers seems to kill it. This little fish is only a few inches long, at the most. Its flesh is so soft and oily that it readily melts like butter. Even the heat of the sun is sufficient to reduce the dead fish to a mere head, backbone and flabby strip of thin skin, lying in a pool of oil. The natives patrol the shore for it after wild weather, sometimes melting it down for lamp fuel and sometimes eating it." According to the lore about the creature, "Quantities of golomyankas are sometimes thrown up after volcanic disturbances. The Tungus natives repeat an old legend that has been passed down by bygone generations to the effect that storms in the mountains rush down through subterranean abysses leading under the lake and blow up these fishes from the great depths where they seem to dwell."</p>

<p>Baikal encourages such legends. Even when the surface is so deeply frozen that heavy vehicles can travel across without risk, waves race under the ice and shake the shore. In the thaw, the sound of the ice splitting can be heard ricocheting around the mountains like artillery fire. Scientists have no explanation for the lake's extraordinary variations in depth; in the summer of 1818 the surface suddenly rose 6 feet and remained at that level for some time, though no blockage was found of any river that drained the lake.</p>

<p>Subterranean horrors loomed large in the mythology of the Tungus, who explained the frequent earth tremors in their region as signs of herds of giant rats that burrowed constantly under the earth, making tunnels in which their tramping feet set up the rumblings of earthquakes. They also described strange races of men inhabiting the unexplored areas of Siberia. One was said to have mouths in the top of their heads, others thick hair all over their bodies. Another group they said hibernated for two months, totally oblivious to every stimulus.</p>

<p>Scientists readily explained these "monsters" as distortions of tribes seen by the Tungus only occasionally in this huge and remote area. Those covered in hair merely wore tight-fitting fur coats, unlike the Tungus's reindeer hide covering. "Eating through the top of the head" was a distortion of the antics necessary for a man in a heavy coat and hood to get food into his mouth. And to the Tungus, nomads with few possessions larger or heavier than iron axes, the carved wooden or ivory statues of more settled tribes looked like men frozen into a catalepsy, both unable to feel and to see when they were brought out of winter hiding.</p>

<p>Travelers to the Tungus' region were also inclined to explain away the legend of the giant earthquake rats as sheer fantasy until a young surveyor named Benkendorf, hired to map out areas of eastern Siberia for the tsarist government, reported some details of his trip in 1846. Mapping an area on the Lena River in an unseasonably hot summer he noted, after pitching camp, that "the stream was tearing away the soft sodden bank like chaff, so that it was dangerous to go near the brink. In a lull in the conversation we heard, under our feet, a sudden gurgling and movement in the water under the bank. One of our men gave a shout and pointed to a singular shapeless mass which was rising and falling in the swirling stream. ... a huge black horrible mass bobbed up out of the water. We beheld a colossal elephant's head, armed with mighty tusks, its long trunk waving uncannily in the water, as though seeking something it had lost. Breathless with astonishment, I beheld the monster hardly twelve feet away, with the white of his half-open eyes showing. 'A mammoth! A mammoth!' someone shouted."</p>

<p>Scientists had known that the hairy, elephant-like mammoths roamed the central taiga and polar regions of Siberia into relatively recent times. Many tribes had objects carved from mammoth ivory, but few preserved bodies had been found. The early discovery of these bodies, which rotted too quickly to be saved, led to a rash of similar excavations and to an explanation of the old legend of the giant rats. Many mammoth bodies were found when riverbanks crumbled or landslips revealed frozen ground. With its tusks jutting out of the bank or its huge hairy feet exposed, it probably looked uncannily as if some huge burrowing animal had been frozen in the act of tearing its way out of the earth. Most Tungus would no doubt have fled in panic, bringing back stories of a rat-like snout and fangs, a hairy face, and wide burrowing paws.</p>

<p>Travelers' tales of mammoth hunting in Siberia built up a mythology around the turn of the century often as grotesque as that invented by the shamans of the Tungus. Reporters told of mammoths so well-preserved that their flesh was edible, of bodies wedged in crevasses with certain signs of recent life still visible - the food in the stomach undigested, the eyes still clear. Incredibly, most of the reports were completely true. A Russian expedition excavating a mammoth at Berezovka in 1901 wrote, "The flesh from under the shoulder, fibrous and marbled with fat, is dark red and looks as fresh as well-frozen beef or horse meat. It looked so appetizing that we wondered for some time whether we would not taste it. But no one would venture to take it into his mouth, and horseflesh was given the preference. The dogs ate whatever mammoth meat we threw them."</p>

<p>Though the mammoth had roamed over most of the world, it was known in temperate areas only through collections of miscellaneous bones, fossil remains, and prehistoric cave paintings. But in northern and large parts of central Siberia the underlying earth remains frozen at minus 4 degrees Centigrade for the entire year. Except for a few feet of the upper surface which softens in the summer thaw, the ground in much of central Siberia is as hard as concrete, a mixture of soil, rock, and water called merzlota, or permafrost, that has remained unchanged for millennia. Prehistoric animals like the mammoth, which fell into bogs or small streams in the thaw, were quickly covered in snow and buried still further by landslips or sedimentation. Captured by the permafrost, they remained much the same as when they died, the bacteria of decay numbed by the constant cold.</p>

<p>In his preface to Part I of The Gulag Archipelago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn recounts a news item describing the discovery, in a frozen subterranean stream in Siberia, of a variety of prehistoric fauna. "Whether fish or salamander," he writes, "these were preserved in so fresh a state, the scientific correspondent reported, that those present immediately broke open the ice encasing the specimens and devoured them with relish on the spot"</p>

<p>Because of its bleakly cold climate and eternal frost, Siberia is one of the few places in the world where the effects of the 1908 explosion would remain unchanged for such a long time. Most of the scars of its dreadful firestorm did not heal quickly but were preserved, almost as if in a deep freeze.</p>

<p>In addition to causing a firestorm, the blast in the Tunguska region had radiated enough heat in a few seconds to melt the permafrost stratum to a great depth, causing swelling of large rivers and flooding. Before the early 1920s only a few of the bolder Tungus, at great risk to themselves it was later learned, had dared to enter this scarred region to see the damage. Indifference, misinformation, and falsely preconceived ideas, as well as the remoteness of the region, had helped to prevent any serious scientific investigation until then; but the official Soviet research body, the Academy of Sciences, was soon to take the first steps that would begin to change this situation.</p>
