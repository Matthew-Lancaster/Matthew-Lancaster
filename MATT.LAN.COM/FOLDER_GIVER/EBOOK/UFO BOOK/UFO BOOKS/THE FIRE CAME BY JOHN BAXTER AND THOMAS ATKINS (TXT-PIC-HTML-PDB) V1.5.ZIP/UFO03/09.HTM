<p>The overwhelming evidence of an atomic explosion in Siberia in 1908 prompted some scientists to look to rarefied areas of theoretical physics and astronomy for a natural explanation. If such an explosion could not be accounted for by any ordinary cosmic object, they asked, then could a previously unknown, extremely dangerous form of extraterrestrial matter have penetrated our atmosphere, producing a detonation equal to 10
<sup>28</sup> ergs of nuclear energy and yet leaving no physical trace of itself?</p>

<p>"It is dear that the Tungus cosmic body ... could not have been a comet," wrote the geophysicist A.V. Zolotov, speaking for many of his fellow Soviet scientists. "Neither could it have been a normal ice, stone, or iron meteorite. The Tungus body obviously represents a new yet unknown, much more complicated phenomenon of nature than has been encountered up to this time."</p>

<p>Space expert Felix Zigel commented, "In spite of the great advances in our knowledge of the structure of matter, we are far from knowing all about the internal, 'deep' properties of matter, about the conditions under which nuclear energy can be released. We do not know but what on June 30, 1908, the earth collided with some very extraordinary, still unfamiliar but natural heavenly body."</p>

<p>Could the great blast have been caused, for instance, by a small body of antimatter? Or perhaps a so-called "black hole" was responsible for the massive destruction of the taiga? Modem theoreticians examined both these newly conjectured cosmic phenomena as possible solutions to the Siberian riddle.</p>

<p>Even before the first experiments partially confirming the existence of antimatter had been conducted with the powerful atom-smashing accelerators at Berkeley and other scientific institutes, its presence in space had been surmised in the 1930s by Nobel prize-winning physicist P.A.M. Dirac and later imagined by science fiction writers like Jack Williamson who, in his Seetee Shock, utilized it as an element in a profound cosmological drama. The premise of antimatter is simple and logical. Why, physicists ask, should there not be floating in free space atoms in which the electrical charges of the particles are reversed - atoms in which positively charged particles (positrons) revolve around a negatively charged nucleus, rather than negative particles revolving around a positive nucleus, as in normal terrene atoms? If a fragment of antimatter came into contact with a terrene object, both would be instantly and totally annihilated.</p>

<p>In the view of some physicists and astronomers, antimatter might offer a natural explanation for scores of inexplicable phenomena.</p>

<p>In deserts around the world, for example, large pieces of fused greenish-yellow glass have been discovered that are almost identical with those found at meteor fall points. Samples have been collected in Libya, Australia, and across central and southern Africa. But no trace has been found of the meteorites that might have created such deposits.</p>

<p>Along the coastal plain of South Carolina, and elsewhere on the eastern seaboard, are found thousands of shallow, egg-shaped depressions known as "Carolina bays." From the air these bays are often quite apparent "Geomorphologists," the Encyclopaedia Britannica notes, "have discovered no satisfactory explanation for these curious natural features."</p>

<p>To the north in Virginia, at the heart of the Great Dismal Swamp, Lake Drummond lies in a hollow, shallow and egg-shaped, burned out of the peat which forms the swamp. Indians claim a "firebird" created the depression, and scientists have suggested a meteorite as the cause of the burned area, which extends down through the peat to the sandy floor of the lake, but no meteoritic object had been found there.</p>

<p>On September 15, 1940, the New York Times reported, "As the 22-foot cutter-type sailboat Rockit II was crossing Long Island Sound near Bridgeport, Connecticut, yesterday morning with four peaceful persons aboard, a shell screeched across her bow and exploded in the water a hundred yards away." The passengers recalled, "The screech came first - an unholy noise. Then, a split second later, the explosion blew up a great tower of water, twenty or thirty feet in the air. It was the strangest thing in the middle of that peaceful Sound. Why, there wasn't even a boat in sight And not an airplane overhead!" Later investigation also showed that no artillery shell could have exploded near the boat.</p>

<p>All these incidents were recorded in technical journals of meteor science as possible results of minute scraps of antimatter striking the earth. A small contraterrene meteor would create an explosion out of all proportion to its size, then vaporize, leaving no trace except possibly the enigmatic craters called Carolina bays, deposits of fused sand in the desert, or such mysterious happenings as the Long Island Sound phenomenon. It might also, some scientists pointed out provide a plausible explanation for the events on the Stony Tunguska. Initially put forward in a paper published in the February 1941 edition of Contributions of the Society for Research on Meteorites, one of the most respected international journals of meteor science, the antimatter theory drew wide attention and some disagreement Lincoln La Paz, author of the paper, then in the Department of Mathematics of Ohio State University and later a leading meteorite expert at various American universities as well as co-translator into English of many papers by Leonid Kulik on the Tunguska phenomena, had anticipated the most common objections to the theory - that antimatter would explode on its first contact with the earth's atmosphere - by quoting physicist V. Rojansky's calculations that "an approximately cylindrical, contraterrene iron meteorite, falling with its axis vertical, will survive transit through the atmosphere. <br>
... If a contraterrene iron meteorite of a size comparable to those of the largest irons conjectured to have fallen should strike the earth, an extremely powerful explosion would result, since, in addition to the large store of heat energy resulting from the transformation of the kinetic energy of motion of the meteoric mass, a vast amount of energy would be liberated by its annihilation."</p>

<p>Willard Libby, the American chemist who had developed the carbon-14 dating technique, published an essay in 1965 with Clyde Cowan and C.R. Atluri arguing in favor of the "antirock" theory. "In searching for other natural means by which a large nuclear energy yield might be obtained," the article stated, "we are unable to find one other than the annihilation of charge-conjugate ('anti-') matter with the gases of the atmosphere." Speculating about the flight of an antimatter bolide through the air, they contended that "only a small fraction of the bolide could annihilate in flight" and that it might remain "essentially solid" until it came in contact with the heavier lower atmosphere where "continued annihilation might heat it to the gaseous stage and dissemble it explosively."</p>

<p>One result of this explosion would be the increase of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere. Estimating that the carbon-14 yield produced by the annihilation of even a small antirock might be comparable to the amount released in the atmosphere by later nuclear bomb tests, such as those at the U.S.S.R. test site at Novaya Zemlya, Libby and the other scientists measured deposits in American tree rings and found that the amount of radiocarbon increased after 1908, though they admitted that there were "uncertainties" in such proof. The science-fiction writer Kazantsev also adopted the contraterrene theory as a possibility, since there was no reason why his Martian visitors should not have used antimatter as a component of their ship or its engine. But most Soviet scientists rejected the antimatter concept, arguing that contraterrene meteorites, even if they existed, could not explain the actual physical effects of the Tunguska blast</p>

<p>The 1969 U.S.-sponsored committee report on unidentified flying objects, prepared under the direction of the physicist Edward U. Condon, examined the theory and pointed out that an antimatter explosion "has measurable consequences. When matter and antimatter come into contact, they annihilate each other, and produce gamma rays, kaons, and pions. If an antimatter meteoroid were to collide with the atmosphere, negative pions would be produced. The nuclei of the surrounding air atoms would absorb the negative pions and release neutrons. Nitrogen nuclei would capture the neutrons and be turned into radioactive carbon 14 As carbon dioxide, the radiocarbon would be dispersed throughout the atmosphere and be absorbed by living organisms."</p>

<p>The same report continued, "The energy of the Tunguska bolide was estimated from a study of the destruction that occurred. The initial quantity of antimatter and the amount of radioactive carbon dioxide produced was then estimated. Sections of trees which grew in 1908 were analyzed for radiocarbon. The conclusion of several scientists is that the Tunguska meteor was probably not composed of antimatter." But to other scientists in the West, largely unfamiliar with the vast amount of data accumulated by later Soviet researchers, antimatter provided one of the few adequate explanations of the Tunguska explosions. This theory, however, was soon rivaled by another even more bizarre suggestion - that the explosion was the result of a collision between the earth and a "black hole."</p>

<p>As early as 1939 J. Robert Oppenheimer, a leading figure in the Manhattan Project that constructed the first atomic bomb, had speculated about other states of matter created by the pressures and temperatures of a collapsing star.</p>

<p>Most average stars, including those the size of the sun, eventually fade, gutter, and die like a bonfire, the outer layers collapsing on the dying core until it becomes a dense, spinning ball of neutrons. Was the same true of enormous stars, many times the size of our sun, scattered through the universe? Oppenheimer believed that these larger stars would collapse in an entirely different and terrifying way. As the outer layers fell inwards, the whole sun would become so dense as to form a new kind of matter, popularly known as a "black hole." Even a speck of this matter might weigh millions of tons.</p>

<p>British physicist John G. Taylor labeled a black hole the "supreme bizarre object" and compared it to a "cannibal, swallowing up everything that gets in its way. Once engorged by it, there is no hope of escape." A report in the London Sunday Times by journalist Tony Osman suggested that a black hole may be visualized as a "cosmic vacuum cleaner, sucking in stars, light, and anything else that comes within range. But it is more than that. A black hole is so dense that none of the laws of physics as we know them can apply and nobody can yet begin thinking of what laws do apply. Inside a black hole you have the origin of the universe run backwards." Such objects would distort the fabric of space, sucking in light rays so greedily that they themselves and even the space around them became invisible; in the presence of another star they would draw in gas and emit floods of hard radiation. One estimate in the 1970s placed the number of black holes in the universe as high as a billion, ranging from some larger than our sun to others, perhaps formed at the beginning of the universe, with diameters no larger than that of a dust speck.</p>

<p>Recently, by means of a man-made satellite orbiting the earth, astronomers have detected X-rays emitted from the constellation Cygnus; these emissions indicate that in one of its binary stars, Cyg X-1, a blue super-giant appears to be circling an invisible star many times bigger than our sun. This invisible neighbor, feeding on the energy of the giant, may be a black hole.</p>

<p>As New York Times science editor Walter Sullivan has noted, "Nothing in the art of the medieval alchemist or the contemporary science-fiction writer is more bizarre than the concept of the black hole." In a recent article he examined the notion that "a tiny 'black hole' hit Siberia, passing through the entire earth and emerging in the North Atlantic." This idea was proposed in 1973 by A.A. Jackson and Michael P. Ryan, scientists at the University of Texas, to explain the blast in the Tunguska region. If such compressed "mini" black holes exist, one might have struck the earth, creating an effect akin to a nuclear explosion, then passing through the planet like a bullet until it exited on the other side and continued its rampage through the universe.</p>

<p>Soviet experts on the Tunguska event examined these new theories, but ultimately rejected them on the basis that they did not match the actual evidence. The enormous body of eyewitness testimony, supplemented by the findings of various expeditions, eliminate the possibility either of a black hole or a contraterrene particle.</p>

<p>Unaffected by the friction of the earth's atmosphere, a black hole probably would have struck without warning and left a deep crater heavily impregnated with hard radiation. The absence of a crater of any kind or severe hard radiation argues against this theory, as does the shape and entry speed of the 1908 object.</p>

<p>From the numerous witnesses who actually saw the object before it exploded in the sky, we know that it was of considerable size and had a markedly "cylindrical" shape, like a pipe or a tube. Some described it as resembling a "chimney." This "elongated flaming object" glowed with a "bluish-white" radiance brighter than the sun and left a broad trail of multicolored smoke in the atmosphere. In its descent over the Tunguska region, the object created a huge ballistic wave that was, according to experts, exactly the same as the air wave of a missile.</p>

<p>The velocity of this cylindrical, missile-like object was at first assumed to be as much as 30 or 40 miles per second, chiefly in order to account for the high kinetic energy of the blast; but the Soviet geophysicist Zolotov later made a more accurate determination of the object's speed. From comparisons of the effect of the ballistic wave and blast force on trees in the region, he calculated that shortly before the explosion the velocity was probably not more than 1 1/2 to 2 miles per second - about 7,000 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Professor Zigel points out that eyewitnesses saw the object overhead and heard its deafening roar simultaneously, which would have been possible only if the Tunguska object's velocity was just slightly greater than the speed of sound, or about .18 miles per second. If the object had passed through the atmosphere at a speed as fast as 30 to 40 miles per second, Zigel notes that "the eyewitnesses would have seen it first and only later would have heard the noise, somewhat as thunder is heard after the lightning has flashed." The final speed could not have exceeded a few miles per second, he concludes, or it would have been virtually impossible for witnesses to
gain concrete visual impressions of the object's shape.</p>

<p>Neither the antimatter nor the black hole thesis could account for the slowly descending tube-shaped object streaming a fiery trail, the barrage of widely spaced explosions, the oddly shaped pattern of leveled trees, the sudden growth of vegetation after the blast, the clear evidence of an explosion above the taiga rather than on its surface, or the scores of other inconsistencies which had earlier discredited the meteorite and comet theories. The known facts seemed to thwart all attempts by scientists to explain the Tunguska occurrence by means of any natural phenomena.</p>
