<p>The Siberian super-blast is approaching its seventieth anniversary. The scientist who first explored the immense destruction site but could not elucidate it, Leonid Kulik, has been dead for more than three decades; and most of the next generation of investigators who tried to make sense of the cataclysmic event are well into middle age or beyond. Aleksander Kazantsev, first to suggest that the Tunguska object was an interplanetary vehicle, lives in an apartment in Russia's capital. Not far from Kazantsev's home, a new generation of ambitious young researchers at Moscow University and the Academy of Sciences study the different theories about the event and sift through the factual evidence, hunting for the sure proof, the ultimate clue to the riddle that confounded their predecessors.</p>

<p>The amount of material accumulated on the subject in the Soviet Union is staggering; few events in Russian history have aroused as much sustained interest and controversy or have so irresistibly fascinated both the scientific community and the general public as the Tunguska "marvel." A bibliography printed in 1969 in the journal Priroda (Nature) listed 180 scientific papers, 940 articles, and 60 novels, as well as scores of stories, poems, films, and TV programs about the great Siberian explosion.</p>

<p>Nor have Western writers on technology and astronomy escaped the fascination of the day the fire came by in Siberia. Both the American Isaac Asimov and the Englishman Arthur C. Clarke, for instance, have pondered the drastic effects that would have occurred if the Tunguska object had exploded over a heavily populated city.</p>

<p>"A fall like that in the middle of Manhattan," Asimov wrote, "would probably knock down every building on the island and large numbers across the rivers on either side, killing several million people within minutes of impact."</p>

<p>Clarke, among the proponents of the meteorite theory, began his novel Rendezvous with Rama with a dramatic warning:</p>

<p>Sooner or later, it was bound to happen. On June 30, 1908, Moscow escaped destruction by three hours and four thousand kilometers - a margin invisibly small by the standards of the universe. On February 12, 1947, another Russian city had a still narrower escape, when the second great meteorite of the twentieth century detonated less than four hundred kilometers from Vladivostok, with an explosion rivaling that of the newly invented uranium bomb.</p>

<p>Set in the twenty-first century, Clarke's novel focuses on a cosmic intruder entering our solar system, initially mistaken for an asteroid but eventually discovered to be an interstellar craft resembling a gigantic "boiler" more than thirty miles in length.</p>

<p>Despite all attempts to label the 1908 intruder from the cosmos with an indisputable identity, it remains after nearly seventy years one of the most intriguing mysteries of modern science. In 1960 Albert Parry, an expert on Russian technology, commented: "Looking for incontrovertible proof that the messenger from the sky of 1908 was a spaceship and not a mere chunk of stone and metal is fast becoming a favorite sport for many adventurous souls in Soviet Russia. Newer and newer expeditions are going into the Tungus wilds to try for replies to baffling points now raised not only by Kazantsev but also by Zigel and his other supporters rallying to his romantic cause."</p>

<p>But now, in the second decade of the space age, it is no longer regarded as merely "romantic" to seek proof of the explosion of an extraterrestrial vehicle over Siberia. Scientific attitudes toward the possibility of intelligent life existing on other planets have radically changed in the past ten years. "Should this [the spacecraft theory] be finally confirmed by investigations now in progress," Zigel remarked, "the significance of the Tunguska disaster would be inestimable." Many experts today concur with this opinion and feel that it is not based on a whimsical hope.</p>

<p>Yet it is not likely that positive confirmation will result from new expeditions to Siberia. Although specialists from the Soviet Union and many other nations undoubtedly will continue to travel to the blast region to examine the scorched and broken trees - despite the passage of years, the original physical appearance of the shattered taiga has to a surprising extent been preserved, thanks to the subarctic climate - it is doubtful whether any revelations of great consequence about the impact site will be announced in the future. By now the facts are in; all existing evidence of the June 30, 1908, phenomenon has been photographed, measured, and analyzed - if not explained.</p>

<p>The present situation therefore is that the nature of the explosion is understood but not the cause. Although the case is far from officially closed, the majority of investigators agree that the total weight of the evidence leads inescapably to the conclusion that the holocaust released over Siberia was a high-altitude nuclear explosion of approximately 30 megaton yield. Yet the mystery of the event is not erased or even diminished by such knowledge - instead, it is deepened. There remains the question, difficult and so far unanswerable by any known natural cause: how could an atomic blast occur in an age when mankind had only a limited grasp of nuclear physics and absolutely no atomic bomb capability?</p>

<p>An essential item of evidence necessary to the final determination of the cause is missing - possibly annihilated by the very atomic conflagration it may have caused. Scientists confronting the Tunguska mystery are faced with a tricky situation similar to that of detectives trying to solve a baffling crime in which the murder weapon is irretrievably lost The corpse has been carefully autopsied, its organs minutely dissected, the fatal wound probed, and the probable cause of death determined; yet the case cannot be securely concluded nor an arrest made without positive proof establishing the identity of the guilty party.</p>

<p>But if the circumstantial evidence surrounding the case is sufficiently strong and detailed, the missing element of the puzzle may sometimes be deduced or inferred and the facts reconstructed from the shape of the remaining pieces. In attempting to deduce the identity of the enigmatic object of 1908, analysts must cope with unique, unprecedented evidence that is often startling and ambiguous. The most recent hypotheses - such as those regarding a contraterrene particle or a tiny black hole - take us to the outermost edge of our present knowledge of the cosmos into highly speculative, untested areas of astronomy and astrophysics where belief requires a leap of imagination or faith. As the science journalist Walter Sullivan has pointed out, "In contemplating such exotic explanations for the Tunguska event as anti-rocks or black holes, we realize how far our ideas about nature have gone beyond what we can see, hear and feel."</p>

<p>But all cosmic exploration, actual and theoretical, depends upon such leaps or imaginative journeys beyond the limits of the known. Exploding galaxies, pulsars, and quasi-stellar radio sources (quasars) - to name only a few discoveries of recent astrophysics - are all elements in a gradually unfolding picture of the complex universe that we inhabit. Without fully understanding or being able totally to prove these phenomena, modern astronomers nonetheless are using them to construct a new model or scheme of our universe. "The production of a scheme is a major effort of speculative Reason," wrote the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead in The Function of Reason. "It involves imagination far out-running direct observations."</p>

<p>The Siberian riddle, which has perplexed our technology for more than half a century, may yield its meaning when we are able to fit it into an imaginative scheme, an amplified cosmological perspective that, in Whitehead's terms, allows us "to transcend the existing analysis of facts." This cosmology will have to be logical and coherent, responsive to observable facts yet always looking beyond them and finally enabling us to understand them. Kazantsev was the first interpreter of the Siberian disaster to see the problem in these terms; based on his observations at Hiroshima and his ideas about space travel, he formulated an abstract cosmological context to account for evidence that appeared inexplicable. His speculations led to an overthrow of the existing attitude toward the event and to the eventual discovery of fresh facts that had always been there but which had not been seen until his theory made them visible. "One main law which underlies modern progress is that, except for the rarest accidents of chance," Whitehead points out, "thought precedes observation." We see, in other words, only what we are prepared to see.</p>

<p>But even Kazantsev had not been prepared to see far enough. Although he was proved to be correct about the atomic nature of the explosion and his spacecraft theory is now regarded by many as a possibility that cannot be lightly dismissed, his cosmology was definitely too narrow and restricted to explain the possible origin of the Tunguska object His picture of our solar system has been outmoded by the revelations of our space technology, particularly by NASA and Soviet probes to our closest planets Mars and Venus. Kazantsev envisioned a space ship arriving from Mars, previously considered to be the only planet in the solar system, aside from the earth, that might have environmental conditions favorable to the development of intelligent life. But since then Mariner 9 has given us a closer view of the Red Planet. In 1971, while orbiting Mars, the probe sent back television images of a barren world without water, an environment as inhospitable to higher life forms as the moon, its surface pocked with volcanic craters and swept by huge dust storms. In July and September of 1976 two Viking landers, the first crafts specifically designed to search for traces of life on another planet, will set down on Mars and scoop up samples of Martian soil for analysis.</p>

<p>In October 1975 the Soviet interplanetary probes Veneras 9 and 10 landed and transmitted the first photographs of the rocky terrain of our other nearest neighbor, Venus, a hothouse globe with a surface temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Although more space vehicles will be launched, some containing experimental life-detector equipment, the rest of the planets revolving around our sun, in most scientists' opinion, are not likely to have conditions favorable to anything except extremely hardy lower micro-organisms. As intelligent beings, we seem to be, alone in our solar system.</p>

<p>In 1973 one of NASA's probes, Pioneer 10, after sending back photographs of Jupiter, headed out of the solar system bearing an aluminum plaque with an engraved message designed for extraterrestrials. The probability of the existence of some form of higher extraterrestrial beings drastically increases if we look past our planetary system which circles an insignificant star on the comer of a vast galaxy containing an estimated one hundred billion stars of all shapes, sizes, and ages. Within our Milky Way galaxy there may be as many as a billion stable suns with their own planetary systems, a million of which may contain warm habitable planets with environments similar to the earth's.</p>

<p>Only fifty years ago we had not yet seen beyond the boundaries of the Milky Way, but we have since then peered into Intergalactic space. Surrounding our galaxy, a relatively modest cluster of stars, are billions of other galactic systems, new and old, thriving and expiring, stretching beyond our present powers of detection. The most distant objects detected so far in this great metagalaxy are the quasars, which emit such strong light and radio signals that some astronomers believe they may be newly formed galaxies. Emanating from beyond the quasars are electromagnetic radiations possibly from the prehistory of our metagalaxy. This complex, interrelated metagalactic system, according to some theoretical astronomers and cosmologists, may be only one of billions of other metagalaxies in a universe extending or continuously evolving into infinity.</p>

<p>Can mankind be the sole creatures possessing the faculty of intelligence and the capabilities of a sophisticated technology in all of metagalactic space? Only a few decades ago, when Kazantsev proposed his theory of extraterrestrial visitors, this question was generally regarded as too fanciful for serious scientific investigation. The issue seemed a subject fit only for speculative writers. Today, after American and U.S.S.R. space probes have visited planets in our solar system and radio astronomy has radically reshaped our traditional concepts of the cosmos, there has been a revolutionary change of attitude among many scientists on the possibility of some form of higher extraterrestrial life existing in other solar systems.</p>

<p>The new attitude is reflected in a statement from a report issued in 1972 by the Astronomy Survey Committee of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences:</p>

<p>Each passing year has seen our estimates of the probability of life in space increase, along with our capabilities for detecting it More and more scientists feel that contact with other civilizations is no longer something beyond our dreams but a natural event in the history of mankind that will perhaps occur within the lifetime of many of us. The promise is now too great, either to rum away from it or to wait much longer before devoting major resources to a search for other intelligent beings. ... In the long run this may be one of science's most important and most profound contributions to mankind and to our civilization.</p>

<p>A landmark study of the subject, Intelligent Life in the Universe, by the Soviet astrophysicist I. S. Shklovskii of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow and the American exobiologist and astronomer Carl Sagan of Cornell University, authoritatively outlined the current state of scientific knowledge of the biological origins of living organisms on a planet such as the earth and convincingly demonstrated the possibility that the conditions necessary for the evolution of higher life forms may be present on countless planets scattered throughout the cosmos. While stressing the speculative nature of some of their ideas, the authors estimate that in the future not only interstellar communication but flight eventually will be achieved. "Especially allowing for a modicum of scientific and technological progress within the next few centuries," Sagan stated, "I believe that efficient interstellar space-flight to the farthest reaches of our Galaxy is a feasible objective for humanity. If this is the case, other civilizations, aeons more advanced than ours, must today be plying the spaces between the stars."</p>

<p>That such conclusions about interstellar life and flight are regarded not only as possible but highly probable by an increasingly large portion of the world scientific community was demonstrated by the first international conference, held in 1971 at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory in Soviet Armenia, devoted to the question of contact with extraterrestrial life. At this week-long gathering co-sponsored by the U. S. National Academy of Sciences and the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, numerous prestigious astronomers, physicists, biologists, anthropologists, linguists, egyptologists, sociologists, and archaeologists from different nations agreed that "the chance of there being extraterrestrial intelligence is much greater than scientists thought possible a few decades ago" and that recent discoveries have transferred some of the problems of detecting other civilizations in the cosmos "from the realm of speculation to a new realm of experiment and observation."</p>

<p>In a 1975 article in Scientific American, Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, who headed an earlier detection experiment called Project Ozma in West Virginia, summarized the new awareness of the probability of life existing elsewhere in the universe:</p>

<p>From the movements of a number of nearby stars we have now detected unseen companion bodies in orbit around them that are about as massive as large planets. From our knowledge of the processes by which life arose here on the earth we know that similar processes must be fairly common throughout the universe. Since intelligence and technology have a high survival value it seems likely that primitive life forms on the planets of other stars, evolving over many billions of years, would occasionally develop intelligence, civilization and a high technology. Moreover, we on the earth now possess all the technology necessary for communicating with other civilizations in the depths of space. Indeed, we may now be standing on a threshold about to take the momentous step a planetary society takes but once: first contact with another civilization. </p>

<p>Yet Sagan, Drake, Shklovskii, and most other reputable scientists involved in this experimental search emphasize that what is meant by "extraterrestrial life" is most certainly not the incredibly humanoid "ancient astronauts" conjectured largely from Latin-American artifacts and legends by Erich von Daniken and other writers following his fallacious but popular reasoning in Chariots of the Gods? (1970); nor are real extraterrestrials likely to resemble the benevolent blond Venusians or little green Martians claimed to have been sighted by some UFO contactees. These fantasies about alien life reflect an unimaginative, egotistically anthropocentric cosmology in which all living creatures in the universe are merely duplications of us, mirrors of our features and fears.</p>

<p>A more rational, less self-centered cosmological viewpoint, rooted in scientific logic, will admit that extraterrestrials, if they exist, are not likely in any way biologically to resemble what we know on our small planet. "Life, even cellular life, may exist out yonder in the dark," comments naturalist Loren Eisley in his book The Immense Journey. "But high or low in nature, it will not wear the shape of man. That shape is the evolutionary product of a strange, long wandering through the attics of the forest roof, and so great are the chances of failure, that nothing precisely and identically human is likely ever to come that way again."</p>

<p>Though life beyond the earth will not assume our shape, we will be related - by the fact that we inhabit the same universe and evolved from the same elements forged in the violent depths of the stars. We are all made, to quote Sagan, "from the dregs of star-stuff." The new cosmological picture emerging today, from ground-based and space astronomy, encourages us to see ourselves and our planet as an infinitesimal but closely related part of an immense, active universe which was created, according to one highly favored cosmic scheme, by an instantaneous "big bang," a cataclysmic nuclear explosion occurring some twelve billion years ago.</p>

<p>In such a universe nothing is fixed or immutable. On a scale of time and space vastly greater than ours, gigantic spiral and elliptical galaxies wheel, burst, and cool in the midst of a cosmos characterized not by stillness and stability but by turbulent events and energetic change. Stars pulsate, flourish, and collapse; bathed in their energy, circling planetary worlds pursue their own peculiar, random destinies, while whatever creatures that happen to be living on their surfaces adopt their own unique evolutionary modes of survival.</p>

<p>Within this considerably expanded cosmological perspective, we can let our imaginations outrun direct observations while staying firmly rooted in current scientific knowledge. We have already accomplished the previously unimaginable - begun the exploration of our solar system. Our probe, Pioneer 10, is now moving beyond our solar system into interstellar space. Is it fanciful or unreasonable, then, to accept that on some distant planet a civilization may be engaged in similar experimental voyages of discovery, launching their own probes and spacecraft? Once we admit this possibility - accepted by many contemporary scientists - we can then picture the missing element in the puzzling Siberian explosion of 1908.</p>

<p>Loren Eisley offers a provocative image about what may have happened in our past:</p>

<p>So deep is the conviction that there must be life out there beyond the dark, one thinks that if they are more advanced than ourselves they may come across space at any moment, perhaps in our generation. Later, contemplating the infinity of time, one wonders if perchance their messages came long ago, hurtling into the swamp muck of the steaming coal forests, the bright projectile clambered over by hissing reptiles, and the delicate instruments running mindlessly down with no report. </p>

<p>We can extend our imaginations far out into space and construct an image of the mysterious missile that blew up over the Siberian woods. The image will be necessarily speculative, for no absolute proof exists; yet it will be true to scientific plausibility and to the newly enlarged cosmological view. Let us look at the event with the perspective of almost seventy years of technological progress and research, weighing again the evidence and ordering it in a way that provides a credible - perhaps the most credible - explanation of one of the greatest explosions our world has ever known.</p>

<p>It is the morning of June 30, 1908.</p>

<p>High above the Indian Ocean, a huge object hurtling from space pierces the earth's atmospheric shell. In the almost airless upper altitudes, there is no sound, barely any friction; unimpeded, it races toward the planet</p>

<p>The object is an extraterrestrial vehicle; its hull is cylindrical, its mass thousands of tons. Propelled by nuclear fire, the giant craft has come from the depths of interstellar space at a velocity close to the speed of light, then decelerated before orbiting into our planetary system.</p>

<p>Now, rocketing toward the earth, the vehicle is in a state of emergency. Within its propulsion chambers, a malfunction has occurred; the temperature is rapidly rising in the fuel core. Barriers that prevent critical mass, the density necessary for a lethal chain reaction, are overheating and melting.</p>

<p>Eighty miles above the surface, the craft's navigational system steers toward a narrow entry corridor - the same atmospheric passage that many decades later lunar flights from earth will hit for safe re-entry. The entry must be precise, to avoid burning up in the thicker atmosphere or ricocheting back out into the void.</p>

<p>Plunging through the corridor, the craft reduces its velocity. In seconds, as its protective shield strikes the denser air layers, frictional heat rises to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, forming a fiery cone of ionized molecules more dazzling than the sun. Within the flaming sheath, the spacecraft glows like a brilliant fireball.</p>

<p>Half of the rotating globe below is in darkness; the sky arching over the other half is cloudless and clear as a glass dome. In a long, sloping trajectory, the craft soars beyond the ocean basin across jagged mountain ridges, steep valleys, vast undulating plains. It navigates directly along a meridian toward the planet's northern horizon, the arctic regions.</p>

<p>A shock wave of highly compressed air is thrust far ahead of the vehicle. The heat shield disintegrates, streaming an incandescent trail of molten particles. Above the northern hemisphere, sensitive optical instruments in the craft register signs of life on the surface.</p>

<p>In central Siberia a deafening roar terrifies the inhabitants of small towns and villages, the only settlements in this remote and deserted area. A powerful ballistic wave pushed before the descending craft strikes the ground. Trees are leveled, nomad huts blown down, men and animals scattered like specks of dust</p>

<p>At an altitude of 2 miles, the inhabitants of the luminous spacecraft make a course correction, steering westward over the empty wooded terrain of the Central Siberian Plateau. The maneuver is their last act</p>

<p>The barriers separating the fuel cells have melted. The nuclear material reaches a density that is supercritical, and in an instant a chain reaction is triggered.</p>

<p>A fraction of a second later, the spacecraft and its occupants are vaporized in a blinding flash of light</p>

<p>A towering primordial fire, hotter than the interior of a star, splits the sky in two and sears the landscape below for more than 30 miles.</p>

<p>Then the great fire is gone, leaving behind only a massive column of black clouds that will remain for days in the atmosphere and a scarred, shattered taiga that will forever hide its secret.</p>
