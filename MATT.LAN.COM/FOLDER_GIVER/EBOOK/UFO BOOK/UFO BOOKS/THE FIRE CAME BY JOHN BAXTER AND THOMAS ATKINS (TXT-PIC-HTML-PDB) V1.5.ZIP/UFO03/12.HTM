<p align="center"><b>Appendix A</b></p>

<p>I.M. Suslov, "In Search of the Great Meteorite of 1908," Mirovedenie, Vol. 16, No. 1 (1927), 13-18. [Suslov, a Soviet ethnographer, was among the first to interview local inhabitants of the Tunguska region about the disaster.]</p>

<p>In March 1926 I undertook an expedition to the Chunya River, a right tributary of the Stony Tunguska, at the request of the Committee of Assistance to the Peoples of the North. I also undertook to carry out some scientific investigative work in the region of the Chunya River whose upper course had never been explored.</p>

<p>The expedition took the following route: from the station of Taishet we went by sled to the village of Keshma; from Keshma we reached the Stony Tunguska at the mouth of the Tataria River; then we went further along the Stony Tunguska to the mouth of the Anavar River; the expedition finally reached the Chunya River by traveling on the road to the village of Strelka that was constructed in 1925.</p>

<p>In recent years during my trips in the Angara area I have constantly heard the peasants talk about the fall of the Tunguska meteorite. These stories, although often created from the most highly improbable legends, raise the possibility just the same of finding the fallen meteorite. The most detailed information has come from I.I. Pokrovsky, who carried out statistical work in the Stony Tunguska area during 1908-1909. Unfortunately, the articles about the meteorite by A. V. Voznesensky and S.V. Obruchev, which were published in the first issue of Mirovedenie for August 1925, became known to me only a few days before I wrote the present article. As a result, I was unable to make use of the considerable data contained in these reports. This would have been of great help in searching for the meteorite during my trip.</p>

<p>I found similar types of stories in the article by A. V. Voznesensky that I had heard in the area of Keshma. This definitely confirms the accuracy of the peasants' testimony about the ringing of the window glass, loud claps of sound like thunder, a bright light in the sky, and so forth.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Anavar River I found the tent of the very same Tungus Ilya Potapovich whom S. V. Obruchev had questioned in 1924 on the Tartaria River. With his family lived Akulina, the widow of his brother Ivan. She and her husband had suffered from the fall of the meteorite, and she told me the following about it. Early in the morning, while everyone in the tent was still asleep, the people were suddenly flung into the air. No one was seriously hurt, but Akulina and Ivan lost consciousness. They were utterly terrified and for a long time did not know what had happened. Then they saw the forest blazing around them with many fallen trees. There was also a great noise.&nbsp;</p>

<p> At the village of Strelka I met the old Tungus Vasily Okhchen who at the time of the fall of the meteorite lived in the tent of Ivan and Akulina. I questioned him two weeks after I had talked with her, and he told me the same story. The only difference was that Vasily had been sleeping at the moment when the tent was tom away and had been thrown to the side by a powerful jolt. He had not lost consciousness. He said that he heard an unbelievably loud and continuous thunder; the ground shook, burning trees fell, and all around there was smoke and haze. Soon the thunder stopped, the wind ceased, but tie forest continued to bum. All three of the Tungus went out to search for the reindeer which had run away during the catastrophe. But they were unable to find many of the reindeer from the herd.</p>

<p>At the time of the fall of the meteorite Akulina's hut was located at the mouth of the Diliushmo River where it flows into the Khushmo River. At the same time Ilya Potapovich lived on the Tartaria River. When the meteorite fell, he heard only long peals of thunder and felt the earth shaking.</p>

<p>Afterward, while they were out hunting for squirrels, Ilya Potapovich and Akulina found on the northeastern slope on the Lakura Ridge, close to the source of the Makirta River, a dry stream-a deep fissure which ends in a large pit filled up with earth. According to them, at the present time both the fissure and the pit have been grown over with young trees.</p>

<p>On the middle course of the Avarkita River at the time of the catastrophe stood the tent of the children of the deceased Tungus Podyga: Chekaren, Chuchancha, and Malega. I met them at the village of Strelka. They said that they had been startled by loud rumbling noises. Everywhere they heard great crashing sounds and felt the earth shake. A terrible storm, so great that it was difficult to stand upright in it, blew down the trees near their hut. In the distant north, a large cloud formed which they thought was smoke.</p>

<p>The Tungus Andrei Onkoul, who now lives at the crest of the Taimura River, said that north of the Lakura Ridge, approximately halfway between the Kimchu and Khushmo Rivers, he saw a huge pit which the Tungus had earlier known nothing about. This pit was also grown over with young trees.</p>

<p>An entire group of Tungus said that a fire suddenly flew into the bank of the Chambe River, slightly below the mouth of the Khushmo River, and quickly burned up two hundred reindeer that belonged to the Tungus Stepan Ilich Onkoul from the tribe of Kurkagyr. His storehouses, which were filled with sacks of flour and with domestic goods, were knocked down and completely destroyed.</p>

<p>Tungus stories about any event must always be carefully checked, even more so a supernatural one, and as in this particular case when many of them lost consciousness and were hurt by the powerful force of the wind. Therefore I took advantage of a meeting with sixty Tungus that occurred from June 1 to June 4, 1926, at the village of Strelka, to carry out an official interview of all those present. This interview also provides extremely valuable information.</p>

<p>Such expressions were heard as "the forest was crushed," "the storehouses were destroyed," "the reindeer were annihilated," "people were injured," "the dogs were killed," "the taiga was flattened," "trees fell from the summit of Nerbogachen (a mountain to the northeast)." ... "this brought with it a disease for the reindeer, specifically scabs, that had never appeared before the fire came." The stories of Ilya Potapovich, Akulina, Vasily Okhchen, Andrei Onkoul, Chuchancha, and Chekaren were confirmed by everyone.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that they all willingly answered my questions about the details of what they had suffered and at the same time were ready to show any place connected with the fall of the meteorite. They readily agreed to my request to draw a map of the area of the catastrophe, Ilya Potapovich drew the map with colored pencils, and a group of Tungus made corrections. ...</p>

<p align="center"><b>Appendix B</b></p>

<p>L.A. Kulik, "The Problem of the Impact Area of the Tunguska Meteorite of 1908," Doklady Akad. Nauk SSSR (A), No. 23 (1927), 399-402.</p>

<p>[This scientific report, written shortly after Kulik returned from his first expedition to the Tunguska region, contains his initial impressions of the blast site and three important eyewitness accounts.]</p>

<p>In, February 1927 the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. equipped an expedition, headed by the author, for the investigation of the impact area of the meteorite of June 30, 1908. The area of the fall was the basin of the upper course of the Stony Tunguska River.</p>

<p>At the end of March 1927, I began to reconnoiter the area north of the Stony Tunguska River. My base was the Vanavara trading station which lies on this river close to longitude 72 degrees east. After a number of attempts to penetrate the taiga north of this river by probing in a northwesterly direction by raft, I finally reached the central area of the fall in June. I made a summary investigation of this area and its surroundings.</p>

<p>In view of the absence here of any astronomical points for hundreds of kilometers around and the complete lack of any maps for the region, I can only estimate the location as approximately latitude 61 degrees north and longitude 71 degrees east - about 100 kilometers northwest of the Vanavara trading station.</p>

<p>The central area of the fall is several kilometers in diameter and lies on the watershed between the basin of the Chunya River and the plateau of the Stony Tunguska. The area is a huge hollow surrounded by an amphitheater of ridges and mountain peaks. These mountains are touched on the south by the Khushmo River, the right tributary of the Chambe River, which flows from northwest to southeast. The Chambe flows into the Stony Tunguska about 30 kilometers below the Vanavara trading station. </p>

<p>This system of tributaries was my main route from Vanavara in both directions. The amphitheater contains hills, ridges, various peaks, tundra, swamps, lakes, and streams. Not long ago, according to the local inhabitants, this area was a typical part of the taiga. Now, both within and outside of the hollow, everything has been practically destroyed. The trees lie in rows on the ground, without branches or bark, in the direction opposite to the center of the fall. This peculiar "fan" pattern of fallen trees can be seen very well from some of the heights that form the peripheral ring of trees. Nevertheless, here and there the trees remain standing (usually without branches or bark). In addition, in certain places there are still some small patches of green trees. </p>

<p>These are rare, however and can be easily explained. All of the previous growth, both within the hollow and in the surrounding mountains and also in the zone that extends for some kilometers around, show the traces of an intense fire. This is unlike the usual fire and is found both on the fallen as well as on the standing trees. It is also evident on the remains of bushes and the summits and slopes of the mountains, on the tundra and on the isolated islands in the water covered swamp. The area that shows the traces of the fire is some tens of kilometers in diameter. The central part of this burned area is several kilometers in diameter. In the part of the area that is covered with plant growth and with the trees of the taiga there is evidence of some kind of pressure that came from the side and produced creased depressions in the ground several meters deep. </p>

<p>In general, these stretch perpendicularly in a northeasterly direction. In addition, the area is dotted with dozens of freshly formed craters of various diameters, from a few meters to tens of meters with depths of tens of meters also. The sides of these craters are usually steep although sloping ones are also found. The bottoms of the craters are flat and marshy with an occasional elevation in the center. At the northeastern end of one of the sections of the tundra the swamp has replaced the tundra at the foot of the mountains for several tens of meters. On the other side, in the southwestern corner of the amphitheater, the swamp ends in a chaotic conglomeration of wet cover.</p>

<p>A detailed excavation of one small crater (1.5 to 2 meters in diameter) filled with swamp water, showed that (1) water can be removed from this type of crater by pails; (2) that frozen peat can be found on the bottom of the crater at the end of June; (3) that the layer of water in a crater measures 30 centimeters and the layer of liquid silt beneath it also measures 30 centimeters; (4) that the rise of the water in a twelve-hour period did not exceed 30 centimeters, i.e., half of the original quantity.</p>

<p>To what I have already described I must add the interesting evidence about the fall that I gathered from eyewitnesses. The peasant S.B. Semenov gave me the following in written form: "This took place in June 1908 at eight o'clock in the morning. At this time I was living at the Vanavara trading station on the Stony Tunguska River. I was working on my hut. I was sitting on my porch facing north when suddenly, to the northwest, there appeared a great flash of light. There was so much heat that I was no longer able to remain where I was - my shirt almost burned off my back. I saw a huge fireball that covered an enormous part of the sky. I only had a moment to note the size of it. Afterward it became dark and at the same time I felt an explosion that threw me several feet from the porch. I lost consciousness for a few moments and when I came to I heard a noise that shook the whole house and nearly moved it off its foundation. The glass and the framing of the house shattered and in the middle of the area where the hut stands a strip of ground split apart. The barn door also broke, although the lock was unharmed."</p>

<p>Another peasant, P.P. Kosolapov, told me in a personal interview on March 30, 1927, that in June 1908 at eight o'clock in the mom-ing he was at the same trading station. He needed some nails; not finding any, he went out into the yard. He began to pull nails out of the frame of the window with a pair of tongs. Suddenly a powerful heat began to bum his ears; he put his hands over them and thought that the roof was on fire. He raised his head and asked Semenov if he had seen anything. "How could one help but see it?" Semenov answered. "I felt as though I had been seized by the heat." Kosolapov had just gone into the house and had started to sit down to work when there was a great clap of thunder and the sod poured from the ceiling, a door flew off the Russian stove, and a piece of window glass fell into the room. When it was quieter Kosolapov went into the yard, but he did not see anything else.</p>

<p>Finally the Tungus Ilya Potapovich [Liuchetkan] told me in an interview on April 16, 1927, that the center of the firestorm was the pasture land of the Tungus Vasily Ilich, the uncle of his first wife. Vasily Ilich was a wealthy Tungus who owned about fifteen hundred reindeer. In the same area he owned a number of storehouses where he kept clothes, household goods, reindeer harnesses, and so forth. Most of the reindeer were in the mountains in the region of the Khushmo River. The fire came by and destroyed the forest, the reindeer, and the storehouses. Afterward, when the Tungus went in search of the herd, they found only charred reindeer carcasses. Nothing remained of the storehouses; everything had burned up and melted - clothes, utensils, reindeer harnesses, dishes, and samovars. Only a few pails remained. All of these places are known to the brothers of Vasily Ilich - Burucha and Mugocha.</p>

<p>Other Tungus and Russian witnesses confirmed that (1) the trees in the center of the fall area lie in a fan pattern and the tops point away from the center of the fall; (2) before the fall this was a normal green taiga; (3) there have been no other fires in this area either before or after the fall and the fire that it caused.</p>

<p>The investigation that I conducted was brief because of a lack of time and supplies and also because of a lack of technical equipment</p>

<p>A further detailed investigation of the area of the fall is very necessary.</p>

<p>In literature on meteorites, if the evidence from chronicles is discounted, there have never been any descriptions of a firestorm produced by the fall of a meteorite although there have been indications of firestorms in the past. In this particular fall we have the first example of a great firestorm which can and unquestionably must be studied in detail. Moreover, this is one of those apparently rare occasions when a large meteorite reaches the earth's surface accompanied by the cloud of burning gases that surround it until it reaches our atmosphere. Finally, the character of the dispersal of the craters in the area of the fall demands more detailed study since this is an unusual fall both in terms of its mass and its speed. In addition, this study will help in choosing a more advantageous spot for future excavations. The best method would be the taking of photographs by a seaplane. It would also be desirable to make a magnetic or electrical check of the crater area. The height of the plateau and the surrounding mountains should be determined as well as the fixing of several astronomical points in order to check the photographs taken in the area.</p>
