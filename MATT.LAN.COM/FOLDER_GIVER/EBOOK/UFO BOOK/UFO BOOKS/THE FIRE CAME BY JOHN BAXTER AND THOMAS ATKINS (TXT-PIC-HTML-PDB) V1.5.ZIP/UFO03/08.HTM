  <li>Could the explosion of 1908 have been atomic?</li>
  <li>Was the sudden, dazzling "flash of light" that seemed to split the morning sky over the Tunguska region the flash of a nuclear blast?</li>
  <li>Was the painful heat experienced by witnesses 40 miles away the instantaneous thermal wave of this flash?</li>

</ul>

<p>These questions set Soviet scientists on a furious quest for new data that might provide the answers, as well as on a search through the mountain of evidence already accumulated by the many earlier expeditions investigating the meteorite theory. In their quest they looked for comparisons to the Alamogordo test and to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, three events of 1945 that marked the beginning of a terrifying new age.</p>

<p>The great explosions of antiquity belonged essentially to nature and, like most natural phenomena, almost courteously announced their coming with earthquake, storm, or subterranean fire. For the people of Hiroshima there was no such warning, nor would anyone ever again expect an announcement of impending doom. At 8:15 on the morning of August 6 the city was leveled by the blast of a uranium-235 bomb code-named "Little Boy," dropped from a height of 31,000 feet by a 6-29, the Enola Cay, piloted by a crew to whom such a mission, despite its terrifying effects, was little more than another "milk run." American journalist David Lawrence, writing in the magazine U.S. News &amp; World Report, concisely isolated the true horror of Hiroshima: "A single airplane riding high in the stratosphere, unobserved and undetected because of its great speed, can appear suddenly over London or Washington or Detroit or Pittsburgh or any city in a peaceful area and destroy human lives by the hundreds of thousands in just a few seconds." It was a new scale of destruction, excelling even the biblical promises of fire and brimstone; and among its many effects on the consciousness of man was to cause a re-evaluation of the Tunguska event. Before 1945 no frame of reference existed to explain a relatively small flying object capable of vast devastation. Hiroshima and Nagasaki provided it.</p>

<p>Nor was the atomic bomb merely a simpler way to make a bigger blast. The form of an atomic explosion differs materially from that created by a comparable quantity of chemical explosive. Scientists measured atomic blasts in kilotons, a unit equal to the energy output of 1 thousand tons of the explosive compound TNT, and later in megatons, 1 million tons of TNT. The Hiroshima bomb was described as the equivalent of 20 kilotons of TNT, but the comparison is misleading. A blast of TNT destroys by a sudden release of molecular energy, while the larger destructive force of an atomic explosion results from the liberation of the energy of the nuclei of atoms in a chain reaction.</p>

<p>A chemical explosive, such as TNT, detonates in a single massive expansion of energy, the shock wave smashing through structures, then quickly moving on. By contrast, an atomic blast builds through a chain of destruction which makes its results far more devastating. First comes the glare and heat of the thermal wave, bursting out at a temperature of 300,000&ordm; centigrade. According to physician T.P. Sears, "It moves outward as a flash with the velocity of light. It sets materials afire without contact between the material and the source of heat. It ignites wood at 1 mile and chars it beyond 2 miles. It travels faster than the shock wave; combustibles may be ignited by infrared rays and the resulting flame extinguished by the blast which immediately follows. The temperature of the ray at 4,000 feet is estimated at 1,800-2,000 C. It roughens granite, 'bubbles' tile roofs, sets gas containers on fire."</p>

<p>Next in an atomic blast comes the shock wave. In three seconds it travels nearly a mile, in eight seconds twice that distance. Houses within a mile are crushed by a pressure as great as 30 pounds per square inch; the average one-story brick house can be demolished by forces between 3 and 6 pounds per square inch.</p>

<p>A chemical explosion relies almost entirely upon the initial blast wave and concussion for its destructive effect. But in a nuclear blast, the honor is merely beginning.</p>

<p>The atomic bomb's primary shock wave is followed by a secondary wave as the first blast, reflected from the ground and from clouds or heavy air masses above the target, crushes down once more, distorting and flattening structures already severely damaged. This second, reinforced wave can be as much as six or eight times greater than the first primary shock.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inside the atomic fireball, the upward rush of superheated air and the fury of atomic fission have created a vacuum which demands to be filled. Air is drawn into the rising globe of fire, tearing apart any buildings in its range not already collapsed, whipping debris, both inanimate and human, into the air. Set afire by the thermal wave, blazing material is sucked upwards, creating the self-feeding holocaust of a firestorm.</p>

<p>All these phenomena - the thermal wave, the primary and secondary shock waves, the vacuum damage, and final firestorm - left indelible marks both in the Hiroshima and the Siberian blast.</p>

<p>Exploded 1,800 feet in the air for maximum effect, the half-mile-wide fireball over Hiroshima expanded so as hardly to touch the ground. About one third of the output of an atomic bomb is thermal, and 25 per cent of the Hiroshima casualties suffered from flash burns. "Shadowing effects were common," read Sears's medical report. "Profile burning of the side of the face directed toward the explosion was often observed. A man writing at a window but otherwise shielded received burns of the hands. Any material whatever acted as a shield. Clothing was of great protective value beyond the 4,500 foot radius. Like sunlight, infrared is absorbed to a greater degree by dark colors than by light colors. Dark designs and polka dots were burned out of garments and tattoo burns were found on the skin beneath."</p>

<p>Scientists examining the ruins of Hiroshima emphasized the overwhelming effect of heat and light on the city. They found, wrote John Hersey in Hiroshima, "that mica, of which the melting point is 900&ordm; C., had fused on granite gravestones three hundred and eighty yards from the center ... and that the surface of grey clay tiles of the type used in Hiroshima, whose melting point is 1,300&ordm; C., had dissolved at six hundred yards; and, after examining other significant ashes and melted bits, they concluded that the bomb's heat on the ground at the center must have been 6,000&ordm; C."</p>

<p>Most survivors recalled the bomb as "a noiseless flash," others as "a sheet of sun." Hersey notes that few in Hiroshima heard the bomb's noise, but all saw the vast, blinding glare and felt the wave of heat, which were followed closely by the roar of the explosion and its shock. Hersey describes the experience of one doctor who "was one step beyond an open window when the light of the bomb was reflected, like a gigantic photographic flash, in the corridor. He ducked down on one knee and said to himself ... 'Sasaki, gambare! Be brave!' Just then (the building was 1,650 yards from the center), the blast ripped through the hospital. The glasses he was wearing flew off his face; the bottle of blood crashed against one wall; his Japanese slippers zipped out from under his feet - but otherwise, thanks to where he stood, he was untouched."</p>

<p>Into the vacuum created by the fireball was sucked all the debris, the smashed timber, the inflammable detritus of the shattered city. It fountained upwards in the mushroom cloud, 40,000 feet high and visible more than 400 miles out to sea. An official eyewitness report of the blast noted that the cloud "was observed from combat airplane 363 nautical miles away with the airplane at 25,000 feet. Observation was then limited by haze and not curvature of the earth." Of the blast it stated, "There were two distinct shocks felt in combat airplane similar in intensity to close flak bursts. Entire city except outermost ends of dock area was covered with a dark gray dust layer which joined the cloud column. It was extremely turbulent, with flashes of fire visible in the dust. Estimated diameter of this dust layer is at least 3 miles. One observer stated it looked as though whole town was being tom apart with columns of dust rising out of valleys approaching the town. Due to dust visual observation of structure damage could not be made." In a curiously appropriate note, the report concluded, "... other observers felt this strike was tremendous and awesome even in comparison with New Mexico test. Its effects may be attributed by the Japanese to a huge meteor."</p>

<p>To the Japanese, what had happened to Hiroshima was indeed as inexplicable as the impact of a meteor. Not even the massive chemical explosions of the heavy daylight raids that they had endured for weeks could compare either in form or intensity with this catastrophe. The sudden, chance phenomena characteristic of an atomic blast, with its multiple shock waves and thermal wave, astonished them. Men were knocked flat while those next to them remained upright. Others were stripped of their clothes but otherwise unharmed. Unlike an earthquake, the tremors resulting from the blast did not persist; yet the damage to the city was far greater than could have been caused by any natural disaster. Of the 75,000 houses in Hiroshima, 50,000 were totally and 18,000 partially destroyed. According to one report, "The destruction was total, regardless of the type of construction, within the half-mile radius. It was severe a little beyond the 1-mile radius. ... From the 1 mile point out to 1 5/8 miles the damage was moderate. ... From this point out up to 2 miles the damage was partial. Plaster was cracked and windows broken out to 8 miles from ground zero. The total damaged area in Hiroshima ... was 18 square miles."</p>

<p>Later observers were impressed by the area's relative freedom from radiation; though in an air burst the gamma ray output is intense, the effect does not persist The air burst therefore ensured that Hiroshima would suffer less from radioactive fallout. The experimental bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, which had been exploded on a hundred-foot steel tower, left the proving ground dangerously "hot." Dust and debris weighing thousands of tons, as well as the vaporized remains of the tower and a nearby farmhouse, were sucked up into the fireball, then sent billowing 40,000 feet into the air, where the mass flattened out in the soon-to-be-familiar mushroom-shaped cloud. This highly radioactive debris drifted across New Mexico, causing radiation blisters on cattle and forcing the Army to consider mass evacuations of some towns in the area. Another important factor discovered at Alamogordo was that the presence of dirt and other particles in the atomic fireball also impaired its efficiency. Consequently, the decision was made only days after the test blast that any bomb used against the Japanese would have to be air burst, thus guaranteeing the maximum possible damage from heat and concussion.</p>

<p>As terrifying as scientists found the New Mexico bomb's explosive damage, they were more in awe of the terrible effects of radiation and heat. Heading towards the bomb site only a few hours after the blast in Sherman tanks sheathed with lead, the observers found an area for which they had no basis of comparison. Speaking of one observer, Lansing Lamont wrote in Day of Trinity:</p>

<p>A half-mile away he saw what looked like a great jade blossom amid the coppery sands of the desert. Where the shot tower had once stood, a crater of green ceramic-like glass glistened in the sun. The fireball had sucked up the dirt, fused it virescent with its incredible heat, then dumped the congealing particles back on the explosion point. They lay there inside a 1200-foot-wide saucer some twenty-five feet deep at the center. The bomb, even from 100 feet up, had so pulverized the earth that the tower's concrete stumps, which once stood above the ground, had been crushed to a depth of seven feet beneath the sand. The tower itself had completely evaporated. Within a mile of the crater there was no sign of life or vegetation.</p>

<p>Scientists named the green glass "trinitite," after the Alamogordo code name "Trinity." Similar tiny globules of glass, many containing fragments of melted metal, were found in the soil at the site of the Tunguska blast. These globules appeared to have been formed by extraordinary heat.</p>

<p>Of the blast effect on flora and fauna in New Mexico, Lamont writes, "The stench of death clung to the desert in the vicinity of the detonation. No rattlesnake or lizard - nothing that could crawl or fly - was left. Here and there carbonized shadows of tiny animals had been etched in the hard-packed caliche, where the rampaging blaze had emulsified them. A herd of antelope that had been spotted the day before had vanished, bound, some said later, on a frightened dash that ended in Mexico. The yuccas and Joshua trees had disappeared in the heat storm; no solitary blade of grass was visible."</p>

<p>An "electromagnetic storm" which followed the blast had deranged many of the delicate instruments; the earlier flash had penetrated shielded cameras, rendering them useless. The few samples of soil gathered by the shielded tank proved too "hot" to analyze, and radioactive fallout remained strong enough even a hundred miles away, where it settled in a white mist to blister the backs of some cattle and raise "gray spots" on the hides of others. The signs of the New Mexico test, because of the "dirty" fireball and resultant fallout, remained in evidence for some time.</p>

<p>Above the Alamogordo test site towered what was to become the most feared and potent symbol of the atomic age, a mushroom-shaped cloud. After the explosion, the still-expanding ball of lighter gases and dust, superheated beyond any fire that occurs naturally, erupted into the thin upper atmosphere about five miles above the earth; instantly the ball of gas was surrounded by a violet glow as heat and radiation ionized the air, creating a more vivid version of the aurora sometimes seen in the higher latitudes where changed particles from the earth's magnetic belts are drawn down to react with the atmosphere. Carried by the winds of the upper atmosphere, the glowing ionized air above the New Mexican desert traveled around the world creating, as did all later atomic explosions, atmospheric glows and odd, prolonged sunsets that faded within a few days as the air cooled and reverted to a more stable form.</p>

<p>Scientists in 1945 noted a substantial difference between the atomic cloud and the relatively familiar signs of atmospheric dust caused by volcanic explosions like that of Krakatoa in 1883. Funneled upward by the narrow venturi of the volcanic crater, such debris rises far higher than the relatively thin gaseous atomic cloud which is quickly dissipated by the first high-altitude winds. Dust from Krakatoa rose into the belt of fast jet streams that lie between 12 and 20 miles up - winds still known as "Krakatoa winds." Spread around the world by these high-speed air currents, volcanic dust forms a belt as much as three miles deep in the upper air. As the sun sets, light striking the underside of the cloud creates the crimson sunsets familiar from Krakatoa and such recent eruptions as that of Fuego volcano in Guatemala in 1975. Most brilliant about thirty minutes after the sun has sunk below the horizon, the volcanic sunset may persist for as long as a year, until the airborne dust gradually sinks to earth.</p>

<p>Part of the United States's justification for the attack on Hiroshima had been that the city held the headquarters of the 5th Division of the Japanese Army. Radio reports named Hiroshima as a "military center" on the basis of its presence there, and the castle in which the division was billeted became the official aiming point for the 6-29 bombardier. Later, Air Force men remarked that the bomb had been dropped almost exactly on target. The whole unit was at calisthenics in the open air when the bomb fell; every member died instantly.</p>

<p>American physicist Philip Morrison, one of the observers sent into the city thirty-one days after the blast, was astonished at the relative lack of damage to the castle area, which must have been almost directly under the fireball.</p>

<p>"Morrison passed the wreckage of the castle which had been the Fifth Division's headquarters," records Daniel Lang in From Hiroshima to the Moon. "The four thousand soldiers there had been killed. Morrison's guide lamented the destruction of the castle, part of which had been used as a military museum, where some souvenirs of an ancient victory had been preserved. The loss of these treasures distressed the guide. So did the fact that a tree planted by Hirohito's father had been burned black and leafless. Some water lilies in the moat of the castle had turned black, too, the guide added, but he was happy to say that they had begun to grow again. 'I wanted to make sure of that,' Morrison said, 'and I asked him to show me the lilies. They were growing all right.'"</p>

<p>The fact that the lilies were still growing proved to Morrison that, because the blast had been an air burst, the area had not been as completely saturated in gamma radiation as Alamogordo had been, where all life had been obliterated. The growth of the Hiroshima lilies was found to be characteristic of the accelerated plant growth which often followed atomic explosions. Not only did the black, leafless yet upright trees around the Hiroshima Castle at ground zero resemble the zone of burned, standing trees on the Tunguska site but a similar acceleration of growth was discovered in plants and trees closest to the center of the destroyed region in Siberia.</p>

<p>Just as the Japanese survivors first saw a "blinding flash" or "sheet of sun" in the sky, the Siberian witnesses recalled that the 1908 fire which suddenly appeared over the Tunguska was "brighter than the sun." The eyewitness descriptions of the Siberian explosion, in fact, coincide remarkably well with those of Hiroshima survivors. According to one account of the morning, "a huge flame shot up that cut the sky in two." Others spoke of an enormous "tongue of flame" or "pillar of fire" that flared over the taiga, followed by a tall, billowing column of "black smoke" - images that fit a nuclear fireball and mushroom cloud.</p>

<p>As at Hiroshima, the brilliant flash in the sky was accompanied by terrible heat. Sitting on his porch in Vanavara, 40 miles from the explosion, S.B. Semenov saw a "huge fireball" that gave off such a fierce heat that he could hardly remain seated. P.P. Kosolapov, a neighbor who was working at the side of the house, felt that his ears were scorched. The heat "seized" Semenov, nearly burning the shirt off his back. Then it grew dark, and he was thrown to the ground by the concussion. The shock wave, which immediately followed the flash and heat, "shook the whole house," damaging the ceiling and breaking windows. After the shock came the loud roar of the blast, like distant thunder.</p>

<p>In April of 1927 the Tungus Ilya Potapovich had informed Kulik that the "center of the firestorm" of the blast occurred at the pasture land of his relative Vasily Ilich, who had a herd of fifteen hundred reindeer. "In the same area he owned a number of storehouses where he kept clothes, household goods, reindeer harnesses," Kulik was told. "The fire came by and destroyed the forest, the reindeer, and the storehouses. Afterward, when the Tungus went in search of the herd, they found only charred reindeer carcasses. Nothing remained of the storehouses; everything had burned up and melted - clothes, utensils, reindeer harnesses, dishes, and samovars. Only a few pails remained."</p>

<p>No later investigator, not even those most completely committed to the meteorite theory, ever discredited these eyewitness reports. Krinov was initially perplexed by Semenov's description of the blaze of heat that seized him, since this was not consistent with a meteorite impact, but later he had to acknowledge that "Semenov's report about the sensation of 'heat' that occurred from the north side at the moment of explosion is of great interest. Apparently the 'heat' was a direct result of the radiant energy of the explosion. He also noticed that a 'hot wind' followed, which apparently was the explosive wave that had reached Vanavara."</p>

<p>Summing up the evidence of the flash and heat wave, Felix Zigel wrote in Zrumiye-Sila in 1961 that in order for the explosion to have caused a sensation of burning 40 miles away in Vanavara, the energy must have been "not less than 0.6 calories per square centimeter." He pointed out that in the village of Keshma, 125 miles from the epicenter, "the flash of light from the explosion was so strong that it caused secondary shadows in rooms with northern exposures. ... All these estimates are independent of one another and show one fact: the radiant energy of the Tunguska explosion comprised several tens of percent of the total energy. But this correlation between the parameters is characteristic only of nuclear explosions. A chemical explosion is excluded without a doubt - for a chemical explosion the ratio between these parameters is much less. Knowing the basic parameters of the Tunguska explosion, its temperature can be calculated. It turns out that the temperature was several tens of millions of degrees!"</p>

<p>Zigel evaluated the evidence of the burned trees, which were set on fire by the radiant heat within a radius of 8 to 10 miles. "Even L. A. Kulik noticed the unusual character of the burning of the trees in the region of the catastrophe," he stated. "According to the evidence of Kulik's closest colleague, E.L. Krinov, 'one can often see on a tree, particularly at its top, both thick and very slender branches side by side which have been broken off at the end and have bits of charcoal.' This is evidence that the burning was instantaneous, that is, as a result of explosion that followed and not from an ordinary forest fire."</p>

<p>Expeditions of the late 1950s and 1960s analyzed in detail the evidence of the burned forest A.V. Zolotov, a prominent geophysicist who led 1959 and 1960 expeditions, remarked of the forest that "one observes an alternation of burned and unburned parts of the area and also an alternation of burned and unburned branches at the top of the same, completely burned tree." Zigel commented, "This means that the combustion of the trees was caused by light radiation from the explosion, and only in those places which were not in the shadow of leaves and branches, that is, it was a radiant bum."</p>

<p>Florensky, as violent an opponent of the atomic theory of the Tunguska explosion as Zolotov was its supporter, devoted much of his time on an expedition in 1961 trying to disprove Zolotov's theories, but the reports of the forestry experts he took with him agreed that "the 1908 fire flared up at several points" and that "the rounded shape of the fire site and the complete destruction by fire of the old forest over an extremely great area are outstanding features of the area; it differs in these respects from ordinary forest bum-out." Even Florensky admitted that "no one has dismissed the possibility of a flash fire," while hastily adding that "it has not been definitely established either."</p>

<p>Florensky's various expeditions, in 1958, 1961, and 1962, also completed the work of establishing the exact point at which the object had exploded. Had it indeed, as Kazantsev suggested, been an air burst? Both G. Plekhanov, of the Tomsk Medical Institute, and Zolotov, measuring the so-called "telegraph pole forest" and noting the way certain hillsides seemed to have been protected from the blast while others were entirely flattened, had concluded that only one explanation fitted these phenomena - an air burst about two miles above the taiga. In 1958, examining the barographic traces from 1008 still kept at the Meteorological Office in Potsdam, Germany, scientists decided that the object seemed to have blown up about two miles above the ground.</p>

<p>Other investigators set out to test the theory still further, sometimes with unconventional methods. In 1959 I.T. Zotkin and M.A. Tsikulin built a 1/10,000-scale model of the Tunguska plateau and studded a 7-by-10-foot construction with tiny pegs that would topple in the slightest breeze. Above the model they stretched a slanting wire with a tiny bomb attached. Meticulously setting it off at different altitudes, they found that when the charge went off at an angle between 27 and 30 degrees above the horizon, the pegs toppled in almost exactly the same pattern as the trees on the Tunguska. They differed with the barographic evidence only in the estimated height of the explosion; according to their calculations, five miles up was a closer estimate.</p>

<p>As a proponent of the comet collision theory, Florensky searched diligently for evidence to discredit this claim. But after detailed calculation he had to announce that "G.M. Zenkin places the emission center at 1.5 km to the southeast of the epicenter of destruction, at a height of about 5 km." The existence of a nuclear-type air burst over the taiga could no longer be denied.</p>

<p>What about the appearance and height of the other sign of an atomic blast - the mushroom-shaped cloud? I.S. Astapovich, correlating the results of eyewitness reports taken over a period in the area, had written in 1933 that "the explosion was observed from many points in the form of a vertical fountain," and he went on to list some of the extraordinarily consistent descriptions of what witnesses had seen. In Kirensk, it was "a fiery pillar ... in the form of a spear," while to those at Nizhne-Ilimsk it "changed into a fiery pillar and disappeared in a moment" All witnesses agreed on observing the rising "dense cloud" or "a huge cloud of black smoke," even though their homes were scattered over hundreds of miles. Astapovich calculated that at "a distance of 450 to 500 kilometres from the place of the explosion, the lowering of the horizon amounts to 16 or 20 kilometres. Hence it must be granted that both the pillar of the explosion and the "black smoke' rose to a height considerably greater than 20 kilometres."</p>

<p>Twenty kilometers is about 66,000 feet The Hiroshima cloud rose to between 40,000 and 50,000 feet. In a 1951 article containing further data on the Tunguska explosion, Astapovich concluded that "the cloud afterward was exactly like an atomic mushroom cloud."</p>

<p>Other eyewitnesses spoke of the "black rain" which fell following the Tunguska blast - a rain identical with that observed at Hiroshima. Astapovich also mentioned other phenomena associated with atomic explosions such as the atmospheric glow and strange sunsets seen for a few days after the 1908 explosion. These night displays persisted from June 30 to July 3 throughout Russia and Europe, and at the same time enormous "silvery clouds" were observed at great heights against the bright twilights.</p>

<p>In 1960 Plekhanov, a major figure in the Tunguska investigation, compared these midnight lights with those following the American nuclear explosion at Bikini Atoll in 1958. He found that almost identical, though smaller, atmospheric and magnetic effects followed Bikini as were observed in 1908. In a 1966 report, Soviet investigators V.K. Zhuravlev, D. V. Demin, and L.N. Demina determined that the magnetic and barographic effects, as well as the zone of destruction of the Siberian blast, corresponded with the 1958 high-altitude nuclear tests conducted by the United States. If the Tunguska event had taken place since 1958, they contended, it would have been immediately apparent to the new sophisticated instruments at the Irkutsk Observatory that a high-altitude atomic explosion had occurred.</p>

<p>The earlier meteorite and comet theorists found no explanation for the seismic shocks registered around the world in 1908 - shocks never before noted in the case of a cosmic body striking the earth, but very similar to those recorded for atomic tests. Nor had meteors ever disturbed the earth's magnetic or gravitation field. Research in the mid-1960s by Sidney Chapman and Aitia Ashour, published in the Smithsonian Contributions to Astrophysics, failed to find any but the tiniest electromagnetic disturbances caused by meteorites and none approaching the scale of those in 1908, which registered even on the primitive instruments of the time.</p>

<p>The most telling evidence for the atomic-blast theory is that of actual radiation damage to the area and to its flora and fauna. Much of the data collected by Tunguska observers and scientists on expeditions of the 1920s and 1930s, though little understood at the time, suggests that the Tunguska fall point was as much infected by gamma radiation as Hiroshima. In 1926, when the ethnographer I.M. Suslov questioned a gathering of 60 Tungus herdsmen at Strelka on their experience of the catastrophe, all agreed on the flare, the shock, and the resulting thunder - but also on an inexplicable aftereffect none had ever experienced before. The blast, Suslov said, "brought with it a disease for the reindeer, specifically scabs, that had never appeared before the fire came." These stories were "confirmed by everyone." Reports on the 1945 New Mexico tests record "gray patches" and blisters on the hides of cattle exposed to radiation.</p>

<p>After 1958, expeditions to the Tunguska region also noted genetic changes in the plants at the fall point since 1908. There was accelerated growth both in new trees and in those damaged by the explosion. In some cases, a fungus infection had spread over the dead wood, then been covered by the wild new growth. Examination of growth rings on living trees showed that around the period of the blast there was a noticeable increase in cell production; the rings were both wider and more pronounced. Those before 1008 varied from 04 to 2 millimeters in width, while after the blast they became as wide as 5 to 10 millimeters. Trees which germinated after the explosion would normally have grown to about 23 to 26 feet in height by 1958; instead, they towered between 55 and 72 feet high. Some of those which survived the blast were now almost four times their expected girth.</p>

<p>Zolotov's 1959 expedition drew attention to these anomalies, and Florensky's 1961 party made detailed examinations. The latter's report stated that "the features of accelerated tree growth established in 1958 have been confirmed by a great volume of data and are peculiar to the central region of the impact area. In view of the fact that the causes of the phenomena are not clear, work along this line should be continued." Later the report said, "Although literature sources indicate that the aftereffects of ordinary forest fires and forest uprooting with which we are familiar from European silviculture should not last longer than 15 to 20 years, they persist, occasionally without noticeable abatement, for a period of 40 to 50 years in the area of the meteorite fall. V. I. Nekrasov [participant in 1961 expedition] has expressed doubt as to the possibility of explaining this phenomenon in terms of purely ecological factors." Thinking that meteoric dust may have fertilized the area so as to encourage growth, the 1961 party planted test areas of grain to see if it grew better than in traditional soil. It did not, proving that whatever affected the trees at the fall point did so only at the instant of the blast and for a short time thereafter. The similarity to Hiroshima's water lilies is undeniable.</p>

<p>Finally, and most convincingly, a group from Tomsk led by Plekhanov in 1959 spent six weeks accumulating elaborate soil and plant samples. Three hundred samples of soil from miles around the blast area, eighty samples of ash, and one hundred plants were collected, each plant having as many as fifteen different specimens taken from its outer bark, its leaves, and its inner rings. A particularly sensitive spectrometer was used to examine the radiation level of all the samples. Even though fallout from Soviet H-bomb tests above the Arctic Circle in Siberia may have masked some radiation, the scientists found that "in the center of the catastrophe, radioactivity is one and a half to two times higher than along the 30 or 40 kilometers away from the center." As for the plants, it was true that the outer rings did show signs of radiation from later fallout, but within the inner rings, particularly in those surrounding the area of 1908, radioactive cesium 137 was found in quantities far above normal.</p>

<p>As the Tungus had reported, "the fire came by" in 1908. There could now be no doubt that this fire was atomic.</p>

<p>How big was this fire? Though the destructive power of the Hiroshima blast was awesome, the force of the Siberian explosion was far greater. In the Japanese city, wood was ignited by the blast at a distance of one mile, on the Tunguska plateau at a distance of 8 to 10 miles from the fall point. The destroyed area in Hiroshima totaled 18 square miles, that on the Tunguska 1,200 square miles. Japanese naval students felt a hot breeze from the Hiroshima blast 60 miles away, while 375 miles from the Tunguska blast, in Kansk - six times as far - a hurricane-like gust of air was experienced. At Hiroshima, severe heat was felt between 3 and 4 miles away; on the Tunguska about 40 miles away.</p>

<p>The atomic blast on the Tunguska was, at the very least, ten times more powerful than that at Hiroshima. But when one takes into account the greater altitude of the Siberian blast and the much larger total area of forest destruction, the possibility exists of an explosion a hundred times more massive - in the megaton range. Soviet authorities and American experts such as the Nobel prize-winning chemist Willard F.
