<p>"The results of even a cursory examination exceeded all the tales of the eyewitnesses and my wildest expectations," Kulik later wrote of his discoveries in the Tunguska region. Standing on the sloping bank of the Makirta River, the first scientist to view the actual physical effects of the explosion, he gazed in stunned amazement at the sight. Nothing he had heard could have prepared him for the immensity of the devastation.</p>

<p>For as far as Kulik could see, both upstream and down, the upper part of the riverbank was littered with the trunks of fallen birches and pines, apparently smashed down by the shock wave of the blast. The lower part of the bank where the forest still stood was cluttered with undergrowth that included more trunks and the decayed limbs of trees. Against the blanket of snow, the uprooted trees and broken branches were outlined in stark relief. Small knolls along the bank, Kulik later wrote, stood out "picturesquely against the sky and taiga, their almost treeless snow-capped tops stripped bare by the meteorite whirlwind of 1908."</p>

<p>The weary party marched northward through ever greater devastation. The number of uprooted trees increased, their tops always pointing toward the south, the direction in which they had been heaved by the blast. In some places entire stands of giant larches several hundred years old had been knocked down; the ground was littered with fallen, dead trunks, their roots torn from the earth, their foliage stripped away. Often the group had to hack its way through the entangled limbs.</p>

<p>Eventually the party reached an area where the dead trees bore, in Kulik's words, "traces of a continuous burn from above." Even the broken limbs of those trees still upright were charred at the break. The fact that every broken branch showed signs of fire indicated that the bums were not those of a forest fire but the result of a sudden, instantaneous scorching - a flash of intense heat that seared and charred everything. As they progressed deeper into the taiga, the signs of heat flash increased. At first Kulik thought the scorching might have been caused by a "hot, compressed-air pocket" pushed before a meteorite. In a later report he summarized his early speculations:</p>

<p>Before it actually hit the ground, the great swarm of meteors must have traversed two hundred or three hundred miles of the earth's air. Pushed ahead of it was doubtless a giant bubble of superheated atmosphere, hotter than the blast of any earthly furnace and under the enormous pressure produced by the meteor's flight. That white-hot air blast was probably responsible for the burnt spot which surrounds the place where the meteorite lies.</p>

<p>After several more days of travel, Kulik made his way up one of the taiga slopes. Atop the Khladni Ridge he could see the entire area for miles in all directions and, for the first time, gain an impression of the total extent of the destruction.</p>

<p>The view before him was astonishing. The ridges of all the lower surrounding hills were stripped bare. As far as the eye could see stretched enormous dark patches of scorched, flattened forest - trees uprooted and laid down at the same angle, their tops facing south or southeast, the dead trunks with their exposed roots pointing directly north. Only in some of the deeper protected valleys to the east and west had the forest survived.</p>

<p>Looking due north from the ridge for 6 or 7 miles to the horizon, Kulik could see little remaining of the great taiga.</p>

<p>I still cannot sort out my chaotic impressions of this excursion. Above all, I cannot really take in the whole majestic picture of this unique meteorite fall. A very hilly, almost mountainous, region stretches away tens of versts towards the northern horizon. In the north the distant hills along the River Khushmo are covered with a white shroud of snow half a metre thick. From our observation point no sign of forest can be seen, for everything has been devastated and burned, and around the edge of this dead area the young twenty-year-old forest growth has moved forward furiously, seeking sunshine and life. One has an uncanny feeling when one sees 20 to 30-inch thick giant trees snapped across like twigs, and their tops hurled many metres away to the south. This belt of verdure surrounds the burnt area for some tens of versts to the south, southeast, and southwest of the observation point. Nearer the periphery, the verdure gradually merges into the ordinary taiga, the extent of the windbreak soon decreases and falls to zero. Only in places on summits and hilltops with a more-or-less normal forest wall facing the air current does an area of prostrated mature forest stand out now as a white patch; and beyond is the taiga, the endless, mighty taiga, for which terrestrial fires and winds hold no terrors, for they leave no greater scars than scratches on the hands and face of one of its people.</p>

<p>Eager to push on immediately toward the center of the blast area, which he assumed lay beyond the distant northern ridges, Kulik urged his guides, Ilya Potapovich and Okhchen, to lead him straight through the burned-out taiga. But the superstitious Tungus, obviously fearful of the punishment which could follow this invasion of accursed territory, refused to go on. Kulik could not induce them to go further north, and he found himself forced, this close to his goal, to retrace his steps to Vanavara and recruit another group of guides.</p>

<p>On April 30, after finding new helpers, Kulik and his assistant left the trading post and traveled by sled for three days back to the Chambe River. Now painfully aware of the difficulty of marching through the ruined forest, he and the Tungus built rafts with which they worked their way up the swollen, rapids-ridden Chambe and Khushmo rivers toward the area of destruction. Then, loading themselves up like pack animals, the party headed north on the last leg of what had become an epic journey. Not until May 20 did they finally arrive again at the area of the devastation. This time Kulik was determined not to return until he had found the fall point.</p>

<p>In another week of arduous travel, during which they often had to cut their way through the entangled mass of fallen, charred trees, Kulik set up camp in a valley near the mouth of the Churgima River. He was now far beyond the Khladni Ridge from which he had first surveyed the region and within reach, he estimated, of the point where the huge meteorite had crashed to earth. To the north, beyond the ridges and hills stripped of trees lay, according to his guides, a large marshy basin called the Southern Swamp, which must be the site of the enormous crater he had come to expect. Using this camp as a base, Kulik made daily trips into the shattered forest, until finally he had circled the entire area.</p>

<p>It was now early June, more than three months since the start of Kulik's inadequately equipped expedition - one which would soon become among the most famous and controversial in the annals of modern scientific investigation. In Leningrad, some of his scientific colleagues, having heard nothing from him since the beginning of his trip, had begun to worry about his safety, fearing that he might have become lost or even died in the uncharted Siberian wilderness; a relief expedition to search for him was considered. Other scientists had not taken his absence very seriously. Based in their opinion on unreliable rumors and tales heard from Tunguska peasants rather than on verifiable scientific data, the trip, they assumed, was taking longer than anticipated simply because Kulik had been unable to find any real evidence of the phenomena for which he searched.</p>

<p>Completely absorbed in his mission, Kulik had no idea that his colleagues back in civilization were wondering whether he might be dead. He had already found and photographed enough real proof of a cataclysmic event to amaze and puzzle the Soviet scientific establishment for decades. His main difficulty as he roamed through the shattered forest around the Southern Swamp, which he now mentally dubbed the Great Cauldron, was in deciding just what the evidence indicated.</p>

<p>At first I went towards the west, covering several kilometres over the bare hill crests; the treetops of the windbreak already lay facing west. I went round the whole cauldron in a great circle to the south, and the windbreak, as though bewitched, turned its treetops also to the south. I returned to camp and again set out over the bare hills to the east, and the windbreak turned its treetops in that direction. I summoned all my strength and came out again to the south, almost to the Khushmo: the tops of the windbreak had also turned towards the south.</p>

<p>After having made his way around the entire rim of the frozen swamp, about which trees lay flattened radially like a vast fan, Kulik knew he had reached his goal. "There could be no doubt," he wrote, "I had circled the center of the fall!" He stood on the edge of the region that, according to Tungus lore, had been cursed by the fire god. Yet it was an area that did not agree with any he had ever seen, and of the vast meteorite crater he expected there was no sign at all.</p>

<p>His notes betray his confusion and a desperate attempt to cling to the meteorite hypothesis which had brought him to the site. A single observer on the ground, clambering over the tangled trunks of huge trees and cutting his way through dense undergrowth, he saw the fall point only in a series of phantasmagoric vistas, flashes which he recorded accurately but which would not be put into context until expeditions decades later, armed with helicopters and sophisticated recording equipment, created a detailed picture of the area.</p>

<p>In places, the taiga was leveled like that of the area surrounding the fall point. "The taiga," Kulik recorded, "both in the cauldron and outside it, has been practically destroyed by being completely flattened. It lies in roughly parallel rows of bare trunks without twigs and tops, their upper ends turned away from the center of the fall."</p>

<p>But in another part of the woods, Kulik was astonished to see upright trees gradually begin to appear among the tumbled debris and the crushed forest with its dead trunks and exposed roots give way to one infinitely more eerie. Near what he was convinced must be the epicenter of the fall, he found himself back once again in a standing forest. Stripped of bark and limbs, as dead as those which lay in thousands on the ground for miles around, a zone of trees in the cauldron was miraculously preserved.</p>

<p>Kulik could only speculate about some freak effect of the shock wave which had left an area of trees protected from the blast. Sketching the phenomenon for a journalist a few years later, he guessed it to be "some kind of node or region of rest due to the interference of air waves," but the dead, upright forest remained one of the most inexplicable discoveries of the expedition.</p>

<p>Beyond the zone of standing trees, which seemed to Kulik to exist in a huge ring around the actual impact point, he found what they had traveled thousands of miles to see - the peat bog in which, he guessed, the vast meteoritic mass had landed. It resembled a scene of utter devastation. "The peat marshes of the region are deformed," Kulik wrote, "and the whole place bears evidence of an immense catastrophe." Several miles of swamp appeared to have been blasted and tortured into a landscape like the fantasy of a surrealist painter. "The solid ground," read one of Kulik's reports, "heaved outward from the spot in giant waves, like waves in water," and he supposed it "actually must have splashed outward in every direction." Beneath a thin layer of new moss and vegetation, the marshy region showed marks of "uniformly continuous scorching, unlike the traces of an ordinary conflagration." In the northwest and northeast sections of the burnt area, Kulik found dozens of "peculiar flat holes" ranging from several yards to dozens of yards in diameter and several yards in depth.</p>

<p>The single, huge impact crater that Voznesensky had predicted did not exist. The shallow holes that pitted the area, Kulik assumed, must mark the fall point of individual fragments of a meteorite. Most of the holes were overgrown with moss and a few were filled with frozen water, but nature's partial disguise did not obscure the fact that they were unlike any known meteorite impacts. Kulik first theorized that "with a fiery stream of hot gases and cold, solid bodies, the meteorite had struck the cauldron, with its hills, tundra, and swamp and, as a stream of water striking a flat surface splashes spray in all directions, the stream of hot gases with the swarm of bodies penetrated the earth and both directly and with explosive recoil wrought all this mighty havoc."</p>

<p>This initial dramatic explanation of the waves or folds in the earth and the crater-like holes scattered about the peat bogs of the Southern Swamp was to be questioned by his fellow scientists and put in serious doubt by the realities of other recorded meteorite falls. Kulik had no satisfactory explanation for the upright trees in the "telegraph forest," later to be revealed as an essential physical clue pointing to the Tunguska explosion's true nature. Soon he would be forced to re-examine his early theories, though he never completely surrendered his notion of the meteoric origin of the blast. On subsequent expeditions he continued to probe beneath the taiga's permafrost for evidence of a meteorite, but always in vain.</p>

<p>The tiny group had brought no equipment to bore into the pits nor to take precise measurements of the region. They could do little more than make a hasty survey and draw a rough map of the locale. Because of the dangerous summer thaws, remaining longer in the wilderness would have been hazardous. Kulik turned his thoughts to returning home and presenting the evidence, contradictory and confusing as it was, to his fellow scientists.</p>

<p>"We had food left for only three to four days," he wrote, "our road was a long one and our one thought now was to get back safely. It was flight in the full sense of the word. We were already living on the remains of our food supplies (our expectation of obtaining game had not been realized), cutting down our rations as much as possible, and shaking out the flour bags. Three or four times we shot duck and once or twice caught a fish, but there was little to be found except puchki [a Siberian plant with edible stems]. For nine days we traveled day and night down the Khushmo and the Chambe to the Podkamennaya Tunguska. Our diet consisted almost entirely of puchki, and we speculatively estimated the weight of our last reserve - the horse."</p>

<p>In late June, preserving "some remains of courage," the exhausted group finally reached the Stony Tunguska River near Vanavara just as a light rain was falling.</p>
