<p>At Fatima no fewer than seven characteristics of UFO behavior were witnessed by thousands of spectators from every corner of the earth. Your public library can substantiate this, and even the United States Air Force, which denies the existence of UFOs, cannot repudiate the details of the incident.</p>

<p>The UFO characteristics observed at Fatima are summarized as follows - </p>

<p>1. A roar like thunder, and a flash of light.<br>
2. A luminous globe of light.<br>
3. A hovering luminous cloud.<br>
4. A buzzing as from a swarm of bees.<br>
5. A material like angels' hair.<br>
6. An unbelievable drying effect.<br>
7. Strange colored lighting effects.</p>

<p>That millions of flying-saucer reports would fit the description of events at Fatima by coincidence is beyond the laws of probability. Equally as improbable would be that all flying-saucer witnesses are familiar with the Fatima episode and consequently give a description to fit the facts of that event. A more reasonable interpretation of the coincidence is that it is no coincidence at all; that Fatima is in fact a corroboration of the reality of flying saucers; and if we accept this conclusion, then we also know that saucerians can project visual hallucinations as well as audio-bypassing sounds. In other words, we know that if a saucer or saucerians were responsible for the miracle at Fatima, then indeed they must possess the technology to stimulate the human brain by electromagnetic radiation, as explained earlier. God (or the saucerians, as one prefers) can project thoughts and ideas to His subjects; He can read their minds and He can hypnotize them. Since He is able to affect the human brain in this manner, it is reasonable to assume that He can also paralyze and blind His subjects by numbing the visual and motor areas of the brain. Present-day flying saucers can do this too.</p>

<p>On an evening in June of 1967, amidst a rash of UFO sightings in central and south-central Pennsylvania, Donald Purde, Jr., twenty-three, became paralyzed-unable to move his arms or legs - as an egg-shaped craft hovered over him on his front lawn. His mother, on the front porch, found her hands "glued to the railing," completely numbed, until the weird glowing craft moved away a few minutes later.</p>

<p>And in September of 1954 in a small village in France, Yves David experienced a prickling sensation over his entire body while bicycling at night. It felt like a steady electric shock. Before long he became completely paralyzed and fell from his bicycle. It was then that he noticed a dark object in the road ahead. From the object a small figure of a man emerged, approached David and uttered a few unintelligible sounds. Shortly thereafter the being re-entered the object, which took off at incredible speed, and David felt the strength and feeling surge back into his body.</p>

<p>Also in France, in the following month, October of 1954, Dr. Henri Robert experienced a similar encounter: he was driving his car when he saw a formation of saucers overhead. One of the objects left the formation as he watched, and swooped down over his car. At the same time the doctor experienced a strange prickling or tingling sensation, and his car motor failed. The UFO landed and from it a small creature - no more than three feet tall - emerged, shone a light in the doctor's face, then climbed back into the craft and took off.</p>

<p>Many more accounts of a similar nature sprinkle the files of UFO literature. Often overlooked or downgraded because of their incredibility, these reports now gain stature and respect when viewed in light of our new knowledge of UFO technology. And so also, the case for "little men" is enhanced.</p>

<p>The Bible is of course littered with cases of induced hallucination and other forms of brain manipulation, but Bible enthusiasts never doubt the authenticity of the stories, attributing the incidents to the supernatural powers of God.</p>

<p>Starting with Genesis, Chapter 2, we read: "The Lord God cast the man into a deep sleep and, while he slept, took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh." This creation of Eve from the rib of Adam is undoubtedly an account of the first surgical operation on the earth, and the anesthetic was, in all probability, hypnosis. Lest you scoff at the idea that Eve could have been made from Adam's rib, consider the recent findings in genetics which indicate - that even a single cell from a living creature contains a DNA-coded plan for the construction of the entire organism.</p>

<p>Later in Genesis two angels came to Lot in Sodom, and while they were in Lot's house the townspeople came to "abuse" the strangers, whereupon the angels struck everyone outside blind, "so that they could not find the door."</p>

<p>Continuing through the Bible in the Old Testament, from Moses to Malachias, we find hundreds of accounts of strange voices and sounds from the clouds, stories of visions and stories of induced paralysis, but in the New Testament the incidents are even more compelling. In the Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 2, we read: "Then Peter began to explain the matter to them in order, saying, 'I was praying in the city of Joppa and while in ecstasy I had a vision, a certain vessel coming down something like a great sheet, let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came right down to me. And gazing upon it, I began to observe, and I saw the four-footed creatures of the earth, and the wild beasts and the creeping things, and the birds of the air. And I also heard a voice saying to me, "Arise, Peter, kill and eat." ... And behold, immediately three men came to the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me; and the Spirit bade me not to hesitate to go with them. ...'"</p>

<p>We should not recognize that the Spirit, or Holy Spirit as it is often called, in this and all other cases is the electromagnetic signal beamed from a UFO by God to His subjects. Even had God wished to divulge the secret of the brain manipulator (there is no evidence He did), the technology of the Holy Spirit would have been impossible for biblical man to understand. Therefore both God and man were satisfied to refer to the consequences of the device as the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Shades of Fatima and the Holy Spirit are evident in the transfiguration of Jesus before the three apostles Peter, James and John. In the account in Matthew, Chapter 17:3-5 Jesus takes the men to the top of a high mountain, where before their eyes his face and garments shine like the sun. "And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking together ... As he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him.'"</p>

<p>Here, in one package, are all the elements of UFO technology: the luminous being, the induced hallucination, the electromagnetic voices and the luminous cloud. Dwelling for a moment on the possibility of this event, we are confronted with only three alternatives to explain it:</p>

<p>1. We can deny the truth of the Bible, claiming the incident never happened.<br>
2. We can accept it as true but not try to explain it, claiming supernatural powers are responsible.<br>
3. We can accept it as true and explain it as a manifestation of super-technological devices.</p>

<p>The first of these alternatives, that the Bible is not true, is at best a weak argument, for although there is no foolproof method at present to determine its total accuracy, the evidence provided by the many fulfilled prophecies within its covers indicates that its authors were either psychic or guided. At any rate, we know that at least some of its passages are correct. Historians and archeologists have also substantiated much of the historical data in its pages: so much so that we can be reasonably certain that all historical elements in it are true and accurate. In fact, if it were not for the references to miracles, the Bible would stand unchallenged as a monumental achievement in historical reporting. The stumbling block, therefore, in the minds of most of us emerges as a reaction against such seeming absurdities as God's making the world in six days and God's talking to Moses out of a cloud. However, if we can even begin to comprehend the magnitude of technological advancement that would make such "miracles" possible, then we would have no reason to question any part of the Bible.</p>

<p>Concerning the second alternative above, that the miracle accompanying the transfiguration of Jesus was the result of supernatural powers, I can only comment that those who believe thus have no reason to question any part of the Bible - or, for that matter, any ghost story.</p>

<p>Besides the evidence in the Bible of the use of a brain-manipulating device (of which more will be seen later, in an analysis of the life of Christ), there is also an excellent description of a machine which today would be called a flying saucer. Also there are numerous accounts of strange luminous clouds like the one seen by the three apostles during the transfiguration.</p>

<p>Considering the terminology available to a non-technological culture, Ezechiel, in Chapter 1 and 10 gives a remarkably accurate description of a flying saucer which visited him as an agent of God. Poetic license and poetic terminology are apparent in his account but should not deter us from the obvious facts. Had Ezechiel used the same language to describe a submarine or an airplane, not a single reader would doubt that he had seen it (because we understand what it is and how it works), but because it is a flying saucer that he describes, many of us prefer to stick our heads in the sand and dismiss the whole incident. Vague, halfhearted explanations will not do: either Ezechiel saw a flying saucer or he dreamed he did. Either way we have another remarkable coincidence: he describes a device very similar to a device which has been described thousands of times in recent years by flying-saucer observers. In the account he says:</p>

<p>"And I saw, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, and a great cloud, and a fire infolding it and brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber, ... [At this point Ezechiel goes on to describe four living creatures resembling men but each having four faces and wings and animal hooves, perhaps part of his description is poetic but it seems more likely that the brain-manipulating device was being used on him.] Now as I beheld the creatures there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces, and the appearance of the wheel and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea: [is not Ezechiel telling us that the device hovered, rocked and yawed like the saucer seen at Exeter?] and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel. When they went, they went by their four parts: and they turned not when they went. [They could fly sideways, forward and back without turning; this is a typical flying-saucer characteristic.] The wheels also had a size and height, and a dreadful appearance: and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four. [Many flying saucers are reported to have lights around the rims which to Ezechiel might have appeared as eyes.] ... for the spirit of life was in the wheels. [Today, because UFOs do indeed give the appearance of being alive, some theorists have proposed that UFOs are a strange new life form] ... And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: [Would not an amplified buzzing be similar to the sound of roaring waters?] ... And these wheels he called voluble, in my hearing."</p>

<p>So we see that Ezechiel describes a craft which came down from the sky with voluble, or rotating, wheels; it shines like amber and makes a noise like that of rushing waters. It yaws and hovers and has lights around its rims. Surely he's describing nothing else than a flying saucer.</p>

<p>Unless we consider "whirlwinds" (which come down from the heavens to deposit and pick up passengers) as UFOs under another description, Ezechiel's is the only true account in the Bible of a flying craft with a definite shape. All other UFOs as described in the scriptures are either plain clouds or luminous clouds. We might ponder the significance of this; it appears that God did not wish men to see His flying saucers in biblical times. He makes this manifestly clear in Job; Chapter 26, when He says: "He withholdeth the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud over it." So apparently the policy of showing the "face of his throne" was abandoned after the incident with Ezechiel: clouds, after all, are much more god-like than "wheels within wheels."</p>

<p>When Moses led his people out of Egypt, they were preceded by a column of cloud. From Exodus, Chapter 13, we read: "The Lord preceded them, in the daytime by means of a column of cloud to show them the way, and at night by means of a column of fire to give them light. Thus they could travel both day and night. Neither the column of cloud by day nor the column of fire by night ever left its place in front of the people."</p>

<p>You might turn back and review the account of the cigar or carrot-shaped cloud that appeared over France in 1954. This object in its vertical position could easily be described as a column of cloud, and glowing as it did, could be described at night as a column of fire. Another coincidence?</p>

<p>On the fifteenth day of the second month after their flight from Egypt, Moses and the Israelites found themselves without food and water on the barren desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. When the people complained, God told Moses that He would rain down bread from heaven and show them the glory of God in heaven: "When Aaron announced this to the whole Israelite community, they turned toward the desert, and lo, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. The Lord spoke to Moses and said, 'I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them: In the evening twilight you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread, so that you may know that I, the Lord, am your God."</p>

<p>References to "the glory" of the Lord in this and other biblical passages inadvertently relate to the appearance of a strange cloud. Indications are that the spectacle is always awesome and is probably accompanied by brilliant spectral effects similar to those at Fatima. (You might reflect on the implications of God's stated reason for feeding the starving Israelites: not out of mercy or concern for their well-being but so that they would know that He, the Lord, was their God.) The passage continues: "In the evening quail came up and covered the camp. In the morning a dew lay all about the camp, and when the dew evaporated, there on the surface of the desert were fine flakes like hoarfrost on the ground."</p>

<p>A "dew" on the ground in the desert? Not likely! Aside from the fact that dew would not normally form in the arid regions of a desert, there is also the argument that if it really occurred as the Bible states, the bread or manna would have been unpalatably soggy. More than likely the substance was not dew at all but a form of angel's hair which God spread over the manna to protect it from the quail and other life forms on the desert. </p>

<p>When Moses received the Ten Commandments from God, the Israelites in attendance witnessed thunder and lightning, and a sound like a trumpet blast. They watched as the mountain where God was became enveloped in smoke, and they were frightened of the Lord. But Moses approached the "cloud where God was,"</p>

<p>Then again, in Chapter 34, "Having come down in a cloud, the Lord stood with him there [with Moses] and proclaimed his name, 'Lord.'" God came down in a cloud and dismounted to stand on the ground with Moses; so we see that the cloud was not God but only His transportation. Inside the camouflaging mist, we can be certain, was a craft known today as a flying saucer.</p>

<p>No better account of a hovering UFO has ever been given than in the last chapter of Exodus. God had given Moses explicit instructions for the construction of a meeting place where He would meet with Moses for the purpose of consulting on problems current to the Israelite scene. When the construction was completed, we read, "Then the cloud covered the Meeting-Tent, and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling. Moses could not enter the Meeting Tent, because the cloud settled down upon it and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling. Whenever the cloud rose from the Dwelling, the Israelites would set out on their journey. But if the cloud did not lift, they would not go forward; only when it lifted did they go forward. In the daytime the cloud of the Lord was seen over the Dwelling; whereas at night, fire was seen in the cloud by the whole house of Israel in all the stages of their journey."</p>

<p>In the Third Book of Kings we encounter a rain-producing cloud-UFO Elias, obviously an agent of God, appeals to his Master to bring rain to the people of Israel to end a famine, but though it is apparent that God intends to answer the appeal, we see Him stall for time, in order that the UFO can successfully seed the atmosphere with water from the nearby sea. In Chapter 18 we read: "And Elias said to Achab: Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain. Achab went up to eat and drink: and Elias went up to the top of Carmel, and casting himself down upon the earth, put his face between his knees, and he said to his servant: Go up, and look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said: There is nothing. And again he said to him: Return seven times. And at the seventh time, behold, a little cloud arose out of the sea like a man's foot .... And while he turned himself this way and that way, behold, the heavens grew dark, with clouds and wind, and there fell a great rain."</p>

<p>Are we supposed to believe that there is secret power in the number 7? Did Achab's running up the mountain seven times make the rain? Or did it make the time? And if the cloud which rose from the sea had nothing to do with the phenomenon, we can see no reason why it was mentioned. Obviously the rain-making technique we saw at Fatima was a practiced accomplishment even in 1300 B.C.</p>
