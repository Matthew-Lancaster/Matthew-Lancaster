<b>Dr. Barry H. Downing</b></p>

<p>One of the most certain facts we have about UFOs is that they emit various types of visible and invisible electromagnetic radiation. While this is a known fact, it is also one of the least understood aspects of the phenomenon: is the radiation a by-product of the propulsion system, is it a natural effect caused by the type of material of which UFOs are made, is it due to electronic signals used by those in charge of the UFOs for communication and intelligence gathering, or is it a combination of all of these?</p>

<p>UFOs give off light that ranges the spectrum from white to blue to red. In a recently reported case, on November 2, 1971, in Delphos, Kansas (USA), after a UFO had landed in a field, it left the surrounding area, including trees, glowing for several days. Persons touching the soil felt an unusual 'numbing sensation' (1) Reports of UFO interference with TV, radio, automobile lights and ignition are frequent. The late Dr. James McDonald, in an article entitled 'UFO Study Via Atmospheric Physics,' (2) reported the case of a visible and radar UFO sighting from a US Air Force B-47 plane in 1957 which was carrying Electronic Counter Measure gear. </p>

<p>With the use of this gear they were able to discover that the UFO was emitting an electromagnetic signal of 2,800 megacycles. We have no way of knowing what kind of radiation might be detected coming from UFOs unless we have the right equipment available at the right time. But the radiation symptoms abound, and the indications are that it could be dangerous for human skin, eyes, and who knows what, to be over-exposed to this radiation.</p>

<p><b>The Pillar of Fire - Visible Radiation</b></p>

<p>As I have explained in detail in my book, The Bible and Flying Saucers, it is my belief that the Biblical religion was brought about by beings from another world under God's direction. The Jewish Exodus from Egypt was accomplished through the intervention of that bright UFO, 'the pillar of cloud by day and pillar of fire by night' (Exodus 13:21), which led the Jews out of Egypt up to and through the Red Sea, and using its propulsion system to split the sea so that the Jews could make their escape. My main purpose in this article is to draw attention to details listed in the Biblical account of the Exodus which indicate that the Exodus UFO gave off some type of radiation.</p>

<p>The most obvious fact is that the 'pillar of fire' by night gave off light. This light apparently varied in intensity, perhaps even pulsating like lightning according to Exodus 19:16. Modern UFOs often seem to be surrounded by a 'cloud,' as was the 'pillar of cloud' by day, indicating the possibility that some type of E-M radiation was ionizing the atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of the UFO. Even more to the point, the God who is represented by the UFO reality claims that it is his nature to 'radiate.' The Biblical term 'the glory of God' refers to his glowing radiation. It is the 'glory of the Lord,' his radiation, which eventually, through the 'pillar of fire,' fills the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:34-38).</p>

<p>Moses had his first contact with the 'pillar of fire' sometimes called the angel of God (Exodus 14:19), when it settled down in the middle of a thicket at Mount Horeb causing the famous burning bush. 'And the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and lo, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed' (Exodus 3:2). The Bible reports not only that the angel of God appeared as a 'flame of fire' in the middle of a clump of bushes, but also that the thicket itself glowed, yet was not burned up, a parallel to the Kansas case cited above. The UFO apparently passed its radiation characteristics on to the bushes around it. This observation is supported later in regard to Moses' contact with the pillar of fire. 'When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God' (Exodus 34:29). This report has its New Testament parallel when Jesus, in contact with a bright UFO on a mountain, begins to glow (the Transfiguration - Matthew 17:1-9).</p>

<p>It is my opinion that some type of radiation energy from the 'pillar of cloud and fire' caused the parting of the Red Sea, baked the seabed hard and dry, and later knocked the Egyptians flat as they drove their chariots into the open sea channel (Exodus 14:19-29). The Exodus moves from Egypt, through the Red Sea, to the 'Mountain of God' (Exodus 3:1), also called Mount Horeb and Mount Sinai, where Moses had his original 'bush' experience, and at this mountain the Israelites spent an undetermined amount of time -certainly several months - while Moses went up and down the mountain frequently to receive various religious instructions such as the Ten Commandments and plans for the Tabernacle, the collapsible Tent of Worship (Exodus 19:40).</p>

<p><b>The Danger of Priesthood - Invisible Radiation</b></p>

<p>At Mount Sinai, and in the instructions for operation of the Tabernacle, we receive further indications that the 'pillar of fire' is dangerous, that one should not get too close to it. Before Moses goes up the mountain, he sets boundaries at the foot of the mountain beyond which the people are not to pass. 'Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to gaze and many of them perish' (Exodus 19:21). The holy nature of God is directly tied to the idea that it is dangerous to come near the Exodus UFO.</p>

<p>After the Tabernacle is built, the UFO hovers directly over the top of it. The priests who serve in the Tabernacle are given elaborate instructions about what clothing to wear when in the Tent of Meeting. 'And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their naked flesh; from the loins to the thighs they shall reach; and they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister in the holy place; lest they bring guilt upon themselves and die' (Exodus 28:42- 43). It is somewhat speculative to try to separate what may have been natural liturgical practice from necessary precaution in the presence of the UFO, but indications are that lack of proper clothing could be dangerous. Only the priests were allowed near the UFO at the Tent, and on one occasion Miriam was called with Aaron and Moses to the Tent for a meeting with the 'cloud,' and after the meeting 'when the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow' (Numbers 12:10).</p>

<p>The Jewish custom of wearing skull caps into a house of worship is probably derived from the need to be covered in the Tabernacle in the presence of the bright UFO. Aaron, the high priest who worked in the 'inner sanctuary,' even had to wear a special piece of headgear made of gold (Exodus 28:36-38), which might be a good radiation shield, as well as decorative (see also Exodus 28:40). The priests had to be anointed with oil before serving in the Tent (Exodus 29:7), which might serve as skin protection, and in fact the contents of the Tabernacle as a whole seemed to need an oil bath (Exodus 40:9). </p>

<p>That which became 'holy' was able to stand in the presence of the UFO without being consumed by fire. God's burning 'wrath' was a constant threat (Exodus 32:10), and on at least one occasion two priests, Nadab and Abihu, made a mistake in procedure in the Tent with the result that '... fire came forth from the presence of the Lord and devoured them, and they died before the Lord' (Leviticus 10:2). Priests were forbidden to drink alcohol before ministering in the Tent - it was a sober, dangerous work (Leviticus 10:9). Moses himself would not be safe in the unshielded presence of God (Exodus 33:17-23).</p>

<p>The ark, which became the centre of the holy in the Tent, was screened off from the rest of the Tabernacle. It too may have been dangerous. (*) It should be noted that as the pattern of the Exodus developed, with the UFO moving forward occasionally while the Israelites collapsed their tents and followed behind, the Tent of Meeting was not taken down until after the 'cloud' left (Exodus 40:34-38), and the cloud apparently did not settle over the Tent until it was rebuilt. Working under the pillar of cloud and of fire was dangerous business.</p>

<p><b>Some Speculative Observations</b></p>

<p>Probably the above remarks are all that I should make concerning such an obviously speculative area. One very troubling issue remains in the Exodus story, however, and perhaps UFO radiation is related to it. </p>

<p>[*] [See also Dr. Bernard E. Finch: The Ark of the Israelites was an Electrical Machine in FSR Vol. II, No. 3 (May/June 1965). Dr. Finch described the Ark as being akin to an electric storage machine resembling a Leyden jar which the High Priest was able to charge to a high voltage of electrostatic energy. If an unconsecrated person, or enemy of the High Priest, entered the Tabernacle, the Ark was discharged and the visitor was struck down with bolts of fire - EDITOR.]</p>

<p>All who have read Exodus are familiar with the fact that after Moses had his burning bush confrontation, a whole series of plagues -frogs, gnats, boils, locusts, among others - came upon the Egyptians, reportedly caused by the UFO reality which guided Moses. Science has for some time been aware of the fact that radiation and biological function interact, and excessive radiation can bring about mutations as well as growth of biological life. My question is: Could intelligent beings from another world bring about plagues such as those described in Exodus by unusual control over the quantity and frequency of certain types of radiation?</p>

<p>We might also wonder to what extent the rate and shape of evolution on earth might be influenced by beings possessing skilled radiation techniques. There is little doubt in my mind that the 'pillar of cloud and of fire' in the Exodus exhibited many visible and indirect symptoms of radiation. Before we can be certain about the meaning of these symptoms, we need more information concerning the nature of the radiation emanating from our modern UFOs.</p>
