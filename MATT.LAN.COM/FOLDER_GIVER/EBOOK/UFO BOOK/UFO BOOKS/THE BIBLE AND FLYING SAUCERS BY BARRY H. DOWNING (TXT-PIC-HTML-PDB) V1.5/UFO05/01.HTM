<p><b>What? - The Bible And Flying Saucers?</b></p>

<p>Before you become either extremely angry or even more extremely amused because someone is attempting to link together the Bible and flying saucers, consider the following: (1) *</p>

<p>(1) We live in an age in which theologians (men who are supposed to be on God's side) are writing about the 'death of God.' (2) This makes some people angry and others laugh, and I can sympathize with both emotions. I think, however, that it is no more ridiculous to talk about the relation between the Bible and flying saucers than it is to describe God's funeral.</p>

<p>(2) To those who have read their Bibles I now raise the following question: Why do angels make so many appearances in the Bible? The 'death of God' theologians say that angels are, so to speak, 'make believe'; they are 'mythological' - angels do not really exist. But the Bible argues -in effect - that the angels caused the religion of the Bible, under God's direction. Consider the following. Suppose that in five hundred years humans on earth should advance technologically in the space age to the point where we were to travel to another world in a space ship and discover intelligent beings who were scientifically primitive. Suppose that Christian missionaries were to travel in space to this planet to try to convert these primitive people to Christianity. How would these people talk about our missionaries? The Bible seems to suggest that angels are very much like missionaries from another world.</p>

<p>(3) It is true that I do not have absolute proof that flying saucers exist, but so many people have seen - or claim to have seen - flying saucers that the term is commonplace. I do not even need to define what flying saucers are. Even if they do not exist, everyone knows what they are! But I believe there is a good possibility that flying saucers do exist, and that they carry intelligent beings from another world. Could these be the same 'missionaries' who started the Biblical religion? You certainly have the right at this point to answer, 'Of course not; it is impossible.' I can understand how impossible it must seem, but I have found the evidence extremely interesting.</p>

<p>The central event in the Old Testament is the Exodus; the Hebrew people were slaves in Egypt, so the Bible reports, and God sent an 'angel' to Moses and called him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. After various plagues came upon the Egyptians, the Israelites escaped, and for the next forty years 'the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night' Exodus 13:21. This strange aerial object looked cloudlike during the day and glowed in the dark, a description often associated with modern flying saucers. </p>

<p>Eventually this strange 'cloud' seemed to defeat the Egyptians in battle; it gave guidance and instructions to Moses, and this 'angel' from God even provided Moses with the Ten Commandments. However unlikely it may seem, the Bible reports that during the central event of the Old Testament -the Exodus - some kind of space object was always present, and the Biblical people believed that this object was sent from another world. We will investigate the activity of this 'pillar of cloud' in greater detail in Chapter III. The New Testament focuses on the person of a man named Jesus, who is recorded to have said You are from below, I am from above; you are of this word, I am not of this world' (John 8:23). Jesus often claimed to have come from another world; he is reported to have had contact with beings from another world, such as during his Resurrection from the dead. He accepted the teaching of Moses, and claimed to be part of a whole plan which included the Old Testament religion. After Jesus had finished his ministry on earth, the Bible reports that he was taken off into space in something which might be a space vehicle. The disciples were gathered with Jesus on the Mount of Olives just outside Jerusalem, and when he finished speaking 'as they [the disciples] were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight (Acts 1:9).</p>

<p>But how could Jesus have been taken off into space in a cloud? The way the Bible speaks about the life of Jesus certainly makes one suspect that his whole Me is a highly improbable story. How gullible can a scientifically minded twentieth-century person be? We would not expect an ordinary human being to do the things Jesus did. But the Bible maintains that Jesus was not an ordinary human being. He did not come from our world; he came from another world, and eventually he returned to that world in a 'cloud.' Once Jesus asked, 'Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before?" (John 6:62). Ordinary white, fluffy cumulus clouds do not carry people off into space. In the space, age I believe that we are compelled to ask: Was this an ordinary cloud, or was this the way the Bible described some sort of space vehicle? </p>

<p>This ascension 'cloud' is one example of many 'Unidentified Flying Objects' (UFOs) which are described in the Bible. There is no reason to expect Biblical people to call a flying saucer a flying saucer even if they saw one. But if they should have contact with a flying saucer, what would they call it? A 'cloud'? We do not really believe that flying saucers get up from our dinner tables and carry people about; I do not think that the Biblical people believed that ordinary clouds carry people about in space. What we have to do is to study the Biblical UFOs; we shall discover that just as UFO is a 'short' form for Unidentified Flying Object, so a 'cloud' is the Bible's 'short' form for some sort of space vehicle which seems to look and operate very much like modern flying saucers. </p>

<p>But one has the right to ask, 'If there is such an obvious relation between the Bible and flying saucers, why has not this possibility received serious theological attention long before now?' Flying saucers have been reported for several years. Why has no careful theological study been made?</p>

<p>One obvious reason is that the existence of flying saucers is highly suspect. If they do not exist, then they cannot have much of a relation to the Bible. Furthermore, it is often falsely assumed that flying saucers are a post-World War II phenomenon, so that one would suppose that this 'new' phenomenon could not have anything to do with an ancient religion. Another reason is that even if the existence of flying saucers were proved beyond reasonable doubt, the present state of theology presents a serious barrier to an immediate study of a possible relation between the Bible and flying saucers. Modern theology assumes that the various beings from another world discussed in the Bible are 'mythological,' make-believe. We shall examine this problem more carefully in a moment, but real beings from another world in flying saucers (if they are real) could not have any relation to the 'make-believe' beings in the Bible.</p>

<p>In regard to the first problem, I cannot prove that flying saucers exist. I can say only that since thousands of people have reported seeing strange objects in the sky, it seems probable that they are seeing something. They may be seeing satellites, stars or clouds, but they may be seeing much more. But I do not have to be 100 per cent certain that flying saucers exist in order to study the possible relation between the Bible and flying saucers. The Bible reports that the Red Sea parted and enabled the Hebrews to escape from the Egyptians. </p>

<p>If I had to be 100 per cent certain that the Red Sea parted before I studied the report in the Bible, I might never study the report. But in fact I can study and compare various modern UFO reports and the Biblical UFO reports without having decided ahead of time precisely how accurate or 'real' the reports are. Thus, although the uncertain state of the existence of flying saucers has probably delayed a careful theological comparison of modern flying-saucer reports with the Biblical reports of strange objects in the sky, this delay was not an absolute necessity, but rather, a reflection of the generally skeptical temper of our times. Modern theologians have been like swimmers who have assumed that the water was too cold, and have not even bothered to test the temperature with their feet.</p>

<p>But even if flying saucers exist, are they not a modem phenomenon? How could they have anything to do with the Bible? Although the term flying saucer is fairly new, and although the UFO 'explosion' occurred after World War II, writers such as Donald Keyhoe and Frank Edwards have pointed out that reports of strange objects in the sky have been with us for centuries. UFO writers such as Key-hoe and Edwards suggest that flying saucers may have come to earth in great numbers during and after World War II because of our development of nuclear power. This is not the only suggestion they offer, and I think another factor bears considerable attention.</p>

<p>Marshall McLuhan has spent considerable effort in illustrating the fact that electronic devices such as radio, television, and radar are an extension of man's sensory system - his eyes, ears, and a sense of touch. Thus McLuhan speaks about Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. (3) During World War II we developed air travel and began to build rockets; radar was invented and used, and finally, as the cold war developed, the earth was literally blanketed with electronic sensing devices. As we began to move out into space in our planes, and as people began to look up to see man-made objects in the sky, they also began to see other objects. One really has no idea what sort of fish are in the sea until he baits a hook and drops it into the water. It may be that flying saucers are recent arrivals. Or it may be they have been there all along - for centuries - but that we were more or less unaware of their existence because we only recently developed our sky 'fishhooks' - our radar, our planes and rockets, all of which are largely products of World War II. </p>

<p>Have flying saucers recently moved into our space, or have we only now moved into their space? If there is the problem of whether or not Flying saucers exist, and if they exist, how long they have inhabited our space, there is also the problem of how open modern theology is to discussing an already difficult subject. The difficulty with theology, if it tries to keep up with science, is that there is always a 'translation lag' between the development of certain ideas in science and the translation of these same ideas into theological discussion. Thus a man goes to school during the early part of the twentieth century, studies science as it is then, begins writing theology by the 1930s, gains theological stature by the '40s, and finally has his ideas popularized by the '60s, by which time the science on which this theology was based is half a century out of date.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century scientists were extremely skeptical about the existence of life anywhere else in the universe. If you apply this thinking to the Biblical material, you might conclude that the beings from another world reported in the Bible had to be mythological - and of course they might be. But now, in the 1960s, most scientists are of the opinion that thousands of other planets in the universe are probably inhabited. That is not to say that all scientists believe in flying saucers, but the fact is that we have moved into the space age; scientific thinking about the universe has changed. </p>

<p>But our most 'modern' theology - the 'death of God' theology - is based on theological assumptions which were in turn based on scientific thinking as it was during the first part of this century. This is what I mean by the 'translation lag,' and I think that it will be useful to examine briefly some of the current theological statements about the Biblical view of space to illustrate how this 'translation lag' has really blinded theology to any serious study of the relation between the Bible and flying saucers.</p>

<p><b>Honest To God - Is God Dead?</b></p>

<p>How does the suggestion that Jesus may have been taken off into space in a flying saucer fit into the context of current theological debate? In fact, this theory does not fit at all. One of the most discussed theological books of the present decade is Bishop John A.T. Robinson's Honest to God. (4) This Christian Bishop argues that the time has come when no Christian can in 'all honesty' believe in certain events which the Bible describes. The Bible has an outdated 'make-believe' way of looking at the world; but we in the twentieth century have grown up, and it is time we learned that there is no Santa Claus. On the very first page of the first chapter of his book Robinson says:</p>

<p>Even such an educated man of the world as St Luke can express the conviction of Christ's ascension - the conviction that he is not merely alive but reigns in the might and right of God - in the crudest terms of being 'lifted up' into heaven, there to sit down at the right hand of the Most High. He feels no need to offer any apology for this language, even though he of all New Testament writers was commending Christianity to what Schleiermacher called its 'cultured despisers.'...</p>

<p>Moreover it is the two most mature theologians of the New Testament, St. John and the later Paul, who write most uninhibitedly of this 'going up' and 'coming down.' (5)</p>

<p>Now if I understand Robinson correctly, he is suggesting that while St. Luke felt no need 'to offer any apology' for the fact that he spoke of the Ascension of Christ in the 'crudest terms,' Bishop Robinson does feel the need to apologize for Luke's use of this language. According to Robinson, if Luke did not know better than to record the Ascension passage, all thinking men today know better than to try to interpret it realistically, despite the fact that the passage reads like an event anyone could have witnessed.</p>

<p>Why has Robinson mentioned the Ascension of Christ on the first page of his 
first chapter of Honest to God? He might have begun by saying how difficult it 
is to believe in the Resurrection of Christ, but instead he began with the 
Ascension. I once heard a theological professor raise the following rhetorical 
question in his class: 'No one today believes in the Ascension, does he? No one 
in the class objected to the question or tried to argue in favor of the 
Ascension, and in all the 'honest to God' debates, I have read no solid 
arguments against Bishop Robinson's opening words regarding the Ascension. 
Robinson has in a sense led with an ace; his first card was one he thought could 
not be beaten. </p>

<p>The question is: Can the concept of flying saucers in relation to the 
Ascension trump his ace? When Bishop Robinson mentioned that Jesus was 'lifted 
up,' he failed to add that the Bible provided a vehicle - a 'cloud' - to do the 
lifting. It may seem highly unlikely that Jesus had anything to do with flying 
saucers, and yet in the space age we must surely have come to realize that space 
travel is not out of the question. Even though a 'cloud' does not seem to offer 
a very likely space vehicle, it should receive our serious attention when we are 
dealing with something as serious as the Ascension of Christ.</p>

<p>To believe in the bodily Resurrection of Christ, as the traditional Church has believed, and yet not to believe in the Ascension, presents difficulties. If we discard the Ascension, we have to ask: What happened to the resurrected body of Christ? If we do not accept the Bible's answer to this question - the Ascension - then we have to make up our own answer. The usual alternative is not to believe in either the Resurrection or the Ascension. It has been precisely this type of problem which has led theologians to the idea of the 'death of God.' The Biblical material in many ways seems scientifically impossible, and because of the Biblical idea of God seems impossible - God must be dead.</p>

<p>Perhaps no other single factor has contributed more to current theological skepticism than the problem of trying to reconcile our scientific understanding of space and the universe with the Biblical view of space and the relation of the universe to God; it is clear that this problem is behind Robinson's thinking. He says that 'we do not realize how crudely spatial much of the Biblical terminology is' (6) (by the word crude Robinson means roughly literal); if, since the Copernican revolution, some people have been able to 'think of God as in some way "beyond" outer space,' at last the situation has caught up with us. 'But now it seems there is no room for him [God], not merely in the inn, but in the entire universe: for there are no vacant places left.' (7) </p>

<p>Robinson admits that he cannot prove that God is not somewhere beyond space, because there will always be 'gaps' in scientific knowledge. He would undoubtedly say that my flying saucer theory is simply another 'gap' in our Know-ledge, and when it is solved, we will finally have to wake up and realize that the 'supernatural' events in the Bible are all 'myths,' stories made up to suit the occasion.</p>

<p>Science will no longer let us believe in angels, or in miracles, or in the Ascension of Christ. There are many scientists today, however, who are convinced that there may be many superior intelligent beings in our universe, and a number of scientists have suggested that just as we are now attempting to travel in space, so other beings from other worlds may have started traveling in space long ago. Those who believe in flying saucers believe that we are being watched by some superior race from another world. </p>

<p>This world view of ours has emerged only over the past two decades, but at this point it is an interesting coincidence to notice how consistently throughout the development of the Biblical material - which covers a period of over two thousand years - we find that at the key Biblical events a person or persons from another world are reported to have been participating, or even causing certain events. </p>

<p>We may have reached the point where we now must take this possibility seriously, however unlikely this may seem to the 'honest to God' and 'death of God' schools of theology. Are angels simply part of our inherited religious mythology, or were superior beings from another world really an important force behind the Biblical religion? Was Jesus one of this group of superior beings, or is this just the impression we get from the childish way of thinking which was part of the mentality of the Biblical authors?</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason Robinson and others of his theological school have not seriously raised this question is that the theologians who prepared the background for Robinson's work did their thinking before the space age, and here I have in mind Rudolf Bultmann, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Paul Tillich. While Robinson seems to derive his philosophy from Tillich and his ethics from Bonhoeffer, his opening comments on the Ascension of Christ and the Biblical view of space reflect the type of thought which has been most clearly developed by Bultmann. </p>

<p>It is Bultmann who has given us the word demythologize, which means to recognize the supernatural events described in the Bible (e.g., the Ascension of Christ) as mythological rather than historical; we must then proceed to reinterpret such myth in terms modern man can understand. Bultmann has chosen 'existential' philosophy as the mould in which the demythologized Bible is to be reshaped. For Bultmann, demythologizing is the modern theological miracle by which water is changed into wine. A childish way of thinking is fermented through existentialism.</p>

<p>What is demythologizing? There are almost as many answers to this question as there are theologians who write about it, but all demythologizers seem to agree on one basic premise: Many of the traditions recorded in the Bible appear, on the surface, to represent historical facts, or at least some fundamental facts with various interpretations added. But many of these 'facts' are scientifically impossible; in a sense, they are simply symbolic representations of the 'inner emotions' of man - an attempt to externalize man's psychological experiences.</p>

<p>A young boy came home from Sunday school, and his mother inquired as to what 
he had learned. The boy explained that the teacher had given a lesson on Moses 
and the parting of the Red Sea. The mother asked. 'What did the teacher say 
about Moses'? The boy replied, 'Well, the Egyptian army chased the Israelites to 
the Red Sea, and then Moses called up the Marines and they built a pontoon 
bridge across the sea and the Israelites crossed on the bridge with the 
Egyptians coming right behind them. </p>

<p>When the Israelites had safely crossed, Moses ordered the bridge to be 
dynamited, and the army of Egypt was drowned in the sea. 'The mother pursued the 
matter further; she asked, is that really what your teacher said?' 'No,' the boy 
admitted with hesitation, 'but if I told it the way she told it, you would never 
believe it.' We shall be examining the Red Sea incident more closely in a later 
chapter, but all of us can undoubtedly share the boy's tension in trying to make 
sense of the Red Sea story. Some modern theologians have tried to come to grips 
with this type of Biblical problem by demythologizing it - by stressing aspects 
of the story that came from man's imagination rather than from history.</p>

<p>Demythologizing seems to be carried out by degrees, depending on one's scientifically or Biblically informed skepticism. Thus while Bishop Robinson accepts many of the implications of Bultmann's work, as in regard to the Ascension of Christ, Robinson criticizes Bultmann for being part of a kind of 'scientific dogmatism' and for being too skeptical concerning the reports of the Resurrection of Christ. Demythologizers are by no means in agreement as to what ought and what ought not to be allowed as Biblical fact, and what must be called myth. (8) There is quite a spectrum even within the demythologizing camp, but the common ground of this approach to the Bible is the assumption that many of the reports in the Bible that appear to be factual or 'realistic' are in fact myth.</p>

<p>We have to admit immediately that there is much historical evidence to support the view that much of the Biblical material is mythological. Bultmann by paid particular attention to ancient mystery religions which are clearly mythological and has used this foundation to predict similar patterns in Christianity. Certainly much of the Biblical language is symbolic - although in a sense all language is symbolic - but I would not want every word in the Bible translated literally, although the 'symbol' may point to a reality which is literally real. The Bible reports that Jesus was crucified. I know of no theologian who has argued that the Biblical report of the Crucifixion is 'mythological.' Everyone seems to agree that Jesus really - literally - was crucified. But when we read that Thomas sought to touch the wounds in the hands of the risen Christ, our scientific imagination is stretched, and we then suggest that this report has a mythological origin.</p>

<p>How can we tell the difference between Biblical fact and fancy? This is the question. At the risk of pointing to the obvious, there are roughly two camps within the Christian Church, which are usually called conservative and liberal. In our own age, the conservatives try to interpret the Bible 'realistically,' whereas the liberals are more concerned with "demythologizing.' The Church is composed of a spectrum of beliefs, ranging from extreme 'realistic' Biblical interpretation, which turns the Bible into something like a dictionary or machine producing salvation, to the extreme 'demythologized' interpretation, in which the main value of the Bible is its 'literary' form rather than its historical content. But most of the time both groups are aiming at what they hope is the 'true' meaning or significance of the Biblical material.</p>

<p>The suggestion that Jesus was taken away from earth in a flying saucer (or something like one) is obviously a 'realistic' interpretation of the Biblical material. But it is not a literal interpretation of the Biblical material, for the Bible says that he was taken away in a cloud.' For this reason I prefer the term realistic to literal as a means of explaining my approach to Biblical exegesis. I am concerned about the truth. If it is true that the disciples really did see Jesus lifted up before their eyes in a 'cloud,' then to demythologize this report is a mistake of a very high order. If it is true that flying saucers really exist, it is a mistake to ignore or cover up the fact of their existence. But Truth is an extremely difficult prize to capture. I cannot be certain that there is no truth in demythologizing. I can certainly see how Bultmann and Robinson have been led to their present positions. The problem of the Biblical view of space is painfully difficult.</p>

<p>Bultmann has done the most to make us aware of this difficulty. In his work Jesus Christ and Mythology Bultmann explains part of the basis of demythologizing:</p>

<p>For the world-view of the Scripture is mythological and is therefore unacceptable to modern man whose thinking has been shaped by science and is therefore no longer mythological. Modern man always makes use of technical means which are the result of science .... Have you read anywhere in them [the newspapers] that political or social or economic events are performed by supernatural powers such as God, angels or demons? (9)</p>

<p>One reason the concept of demythologizing presents such a problem is that 
there is a considerable amount of truth in it. Not even the most conservative 
theologian would argue that our 'world view' today is the same as the world view 
of men two thousand years ago. In a society of planned obsolescence, synthetic 
drugs, and teen-age fads it is impossible to believe that man's world is static. 
Yet there are activities common to man today and two thousand years ago that 
hardly need to be interpreted for our own times. </p>

<p>On one occasion we read in Scripture (John 21:9 ff.) that Jesus apparently 
built a charcoal fire and prepared fish for the disciples to eat after they came 
in from their fishing boat. Jesus offered them breakfast of fish and bread. 
There seems to be nothing here that offends the modern mind, that needs to be 
'demythologized,' except for the fact that the Bible maintains that the occasion 
on which Jesus prepared this breakfast 'was now the third time that Jesus was 
revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead' (John 21:14).</p>

<p>Bishop Robinson explains the case for demythologizing the New Testament by saying that just as we had the great debate over a 'literal' creation a century ago, now the debate must be over 'the last things.'</p>

<p>Is it necessary for the Biblical faith to be expressed in terms of this world-view, which in its way is as primitive philosophically as the Genesis stories are primitive scientifically? (10)</p>

<p>Robinson's mistake here is similar to the mistake fundamentalists seem to make: the fact that the Bible is a single book under one cover helps us to forget that the Biblical material was collected over a period of time which is about equal to the time that lies between us and the life of Christ. If Christians a century ago made the mistake of trying to defend the Creation story as an account which in its own way was as scientific and historical as the Biblical description of the Crucifixion of Christ, so now 'demythologizers' are assuming that since Genesis had to be demythologized, everything must be so treated. There is a world of difference between Genesis 1, Psalms, Matthew, Acts, and Revelation.</p>

<p>One rule by which we might approach the problem of deciding whether it may be dangerous to demythologize a particular passage in Scripture is to investigate on one hand to what extent the materials involved seem to represent an interpretation of a particular experience, and on the other hand what materials comprise description, or reporting of empirical data. Interpretation and description are of course tightly interwoven, and yet even the most devoted demythologizer will usually admit that there was a historical Jesus of some sort. It seems fair to assume that the disciples shared common experiences with this Jesus - such as eating a meal with him. The total sum of their experiences led the disciples to the interpretation (with the prompting of the Holy Spirit) that Jesus was the Christ. But what sort of experiences brought the disciples to the conclusion that Jesus was the Christ? Why did the disciples settle on him as the Christ rather than on one of the two thieves crucified with him?</p>

<p>Those who consider the Resurrection of Christ 'mythological' must suppose that the Resurrection was an idea which the disciples projected onto Jesus. 'Resurrections' were part of the mythological world view of the Bible. But the Biblical materials lead us to believe that it was no more part of the Biblical world view for people to rise from the dead than it is part of our world view. The Gospel of John even records that the hardheaded empiricist Thomas said, 'Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe' (John 20:25). If the Resurrection is mythological, then this passage is meant deliberately to deceive us. The Resurrection seems to be something we all could have experienced if we had been there - but we were not, and therefore we suspect that it should be demythologized.</p>

<p>Bishop Robinson asks: 'Is it necessary for the Biblical faith to be expressed in terms of this world-view?' this 'primitive' world view. Cannot we reinterpret the Biblical materials without losing anything? It seems to me that if we demythologize the Resurrection, we have little right as a Church to preach that the 'existential resurrection' of Christ will ensure Christians eternal life - life after death. It may be selfish to be concerned with life after death, but Jesus treats life after death as a 'fact' - it happens to people. If it is a fact, for the Church to 'demythologize' this fact will undoubtedly be a great disservice to the human race - and to the gospel itself. The gospel seems to offer eternal resurrected life to Christians. What God has given is not the domain of theology to take away. Jesus believed in a world of resurrected persons and of angels. They go together. Although the idea of angels may be an offense to our modern minds, perhaps we can endure the offense for the sake of the 'profit' motive.</p>

<p>In any case, we have arrived at the point where we have to take seriously again the idea that perhaps intelligent superior beings were at work bringing about the Biblical religion. These beings were not totally responsible for the Biblical religion - the religion grew among men, in the midst of flesh, blood, and history. But who planted the religion? Did man deceive himself; did he create God himself in his own image? Or, as the Bible suggests, did God create man in his image?  </p>

<p>The Bible suggests, as we shall shortly see in detail, that God made himself known through 'angels', beings from another world. I have said almost nothing up to this point about God, whether with Bishop Robinson he is 'up there' or 'out there' or wherever. Nor have I said much about God's being dead, with Thomas J.J. Altizer. (11) Jesus said, 'He who has seen me has seen the Father' (John 14:9). If God was in Christ, then it has only to be shown that there are good grounds for believing that Jesus is now alive, and it will also have been shown that God is no more dead now than he ever was. Was Christ raised from the dead? Did he ascend before the disciples to another world? These are the questions.</p>

<p>The Bible clearly claims in many key instances that 'Unidentified Flying Objects' played a significant role in the development of the Hebrew-Christian faith, and it also claims that superior beings from another world (angels) made significant contributions at various times. The question I am here raising is: What is the evidence for a 'realistic' rather than a 'mythological' interpretation of the relevant Biblical and modern data, and what is its significance?</p>

<p><b>Intellectual Honesty And The Probability Of Truth</b></p>

<p>There is one other subsidiary aspect of the current theological debate to which I wish to draw attention. Those who are trying to remove the supernatural aspects of the Christian faith by demythologizing or some other process usually do so in the name of 'intellectual honesty.' Thus Bishop Robinson has given his book the title Honest to God; he believes that the strength of his position lies in his intellectual honesty. Bishop James Pike, who seems to share Robinson's basic sentiments, has written a book entitled A Time for Christian Candor. (12) Bultmann, who has led the demythologizing program, speaks about a 'sacrificium intellectus.' (13) Whether the expression is in Latin or English, whether the word is honesty or candor, the basic implication is the same. It is intellectually dishonest for Christians to continue to support the orthodox Christian interpretation of the Biblical materials which are apparently supernatural, such as the Resurrection and the Ascension. Robinson explains, 'All I can do is to try to be honest - honest to God and about God - and to follow the argument wherever it leads.' (14)</p>

<p>Now I certainly do not recommend that theologians be dishonest. Yet I do not believe that honesty should be the only test, or the primary test, of the adequacy of any theology. One of the main reasons modern theologians argue the need to be 'honest' about theology is that our 'modem scientific world view' will no longer allow us to accept a realistic Christian faith. I believe it is interesting that Albert Einstein never wrote a book under the title Honest to Relativity or A Time for Scientific Candor. Scientists generally do not concern themselves with honesty in their books. They are interested in something else - truth. When people read a book by a scientist, they assume that he is being honest, and they also assume that the main aim of a scientist's book is to try to get at the truth, however elusive truth may be.</p>

<p>If we are concerned about the 'scientific world view,' we would do well to follow the example of scientists and keep truth rather than honesty as the major goal of our theological studies; if we do not, we can easily fall into a pit. A blind man may with all honesty maintain that light does not exist; men who can see light will perhaps commend the honesty of the blind man, but they will wish that he were more concerned with the truth about the existence of light.</p>

<p>He might through careful research, discover his blindness as the cause of the fact that he does not Believe in the existence of light. I am not suggesting that theologians such as Robinson are blind; this book may have less truth in it than Robinson's Honest to God. Robinson is a well-trained theologian. But I do not believe that, in saying, 'All I can do is to try to be honest,' Robinson is in fact being honest. Cannot Robinson try to be truthful - even if he fails? In fact, does not Robinson suppose that his book approaches more than honesty - that it approaches the truth? It is much easier to be satisfied with achieving honesty than truth, although in this age - which is all too well aware of the subconscious desires of Freudian psychology - I think that we would all be suspect of how capable any of us are of truly being honest. </p>

<p>Furthermore, if any of us asks the question of ourselves, 'Am I truly being honest in my religious beliefs?' we would all have to answer, 'I am not certain,' and in all probability we would be left with guilt feelings about our religious honesty. This type of thinking does a lot of unnecessary damage to the Christian Church; if liberal theologians who raise the question of 'honesty' wonder why conservatives often react with hostility toward them, I think that one cause is right here. All Christians have enough guilt feelings with which to deal without the added burden of feeling guilty about being a Christian.</p>

<p>If we focus upon the problem of truth rather than the concept of honesty, we shall find that this problem of guilt disappears. Of course, it may be difficult to believe a realistic interpretation of the Christian religion - that Jesus turned water to wine or rose from the dead - but if a person is convinced that the realistic interpretation is true, however improbable, it would seem that he can believe it if he so desires (without feeling guilty). It is probably more than coincidental that Bultmann recommends that after the Christian faith is demythologized, the faith then be expressed in terms of 'existential' philosophy. Sigmar von Fersen opens his definition of 'Existential Philosophy' by saying that it 'determines the worth of knowledge not in relation to truth but according to its biological value contained in the pure data of consciousness.' (15) I think that the influence of existential philosophy on theology helps account for the fact that many theologians such as Robinson are concerned with 'honesty' rather than with 'truth.'</p>

<p>Jesus said that he was the truth (John 14:6) and Paul encouraged Christians to think about whatsoever things are true' (Philippians 4:8). While a study of the Biblical idea of truth might be useful, most of us undoubtedly share Pilate's confusion, 'What is truth?' (John 18:38). Pilate's mistake was not in raising the question, but in washing his hands of the question in the face of a difficult situation.</p>

<p>In the field of science men often find it useful to deal with truth within limits. In a hypothetical situation, let us say, the purity of a chemical must range between 80 and 90 per cent. A quality control technician will find the chemical suitably 'true' if it lies somewhere in the range of 85 per cent plus or minus 5 per cent. The purity of this chemical may vary with certain degrees, and the probability of the success of any experiment using this chemical depends on the success of the quality control person. Einstein's theory of relativity has made us more conscious of the extent to which the observer himself limits the adequacy of any theory or experiment. </p>

<p>Every scientist is limited by the scientific age in which he lives. Isaac Newton made a fantastic contribution to the fields of dynamics and optics, but he did not have an electron microscope or knowledge of nuclear physics to see that his idea of a 'solid' atom was not true. In the face of the evidence at his disposal, he suggested that atoms were hard and unbreakable, but that was in the seventeenth century. Bultmann 
recognizes, at least verbally, that The science of today is no longer the same 
as it was in the nineteenth century, and to be sure, all the results of science 
are relative, and no world-view of yesterday or today or tomorrow is 
definitive.' (16) Thus, if our world view is constantly changing, why should 
science force us to demythologize? Because what science has really given us is 
not so much concrete explanations but a way of thinking about the world, science 
attempts 'to give reasonable proofs for every statement. (17) </p>

<p>The contrast between the Biblical and modern world view is between two types 
of thinking, the mythological (Biblical) and the scientific (which requires 
proofs). Here again we cannot help noticing doubting Thomas. If the Bible is 
un-concerned with 'proof' the whole sequence in which Thomas seeks to touch the 
risen Christ is out of place with the 'mythological' way of thinking. We shall 
return to the problem of 'proof' in religion and science later, but I shall 
simply point out that it is possible that the disciples followed Christ, and 
proclaimed his Resurrection, because they had no choice. For them it was a 
historical fact, or certainly it could have been.</p>

<p>If Christ would appear to us all, the problem would be solved. But the 
evidence behind the Biblical faith varies within limits or degrees. Thomas and 
the Apostle Paul were subjected to the highest degree of empirical verification. 
Those who talked immediately to the disciples also had a reasonably high degree 
of verification, especially when the disciples worked miracles. We have the 
written Biblical record, but when one accepts the premise that the Biblical 
material is 'mythological,' this of course weakens any possible witness of the 
Bible from a realistic point of view. </p>

<p>Those who decide in favor of a realistic Biblical interpretation will 
undoubtedly share the emotional temper of Thomas. Perhaps if persons were 
subjected to higher degrees of verification they would make more effective 
Christians, and it may be that one reason only God can judge in the last day 
(Matthew 7:1) is that only he knows the extent to which each man has been 
subjected to the claims of the gospel - the degree of verification which has 
sought to claim him for Christ, especially the informing presence of the Holy 
Spirit.</p>

<p>If both science and theology, however, are only relatively true, or true 
within certain limits, why should we be concerned about the accuracy of one 
theology over another, or one church over another? Why are not all religious 
beliefs equally valid? In science if the quality control of a chemical does not 
keep it within the prescribed limits - between 80 and 90 per cent pure - it may 
cease to function. If a chemical does not measure up to minimum specifications, 
it may be useless for industrial purposes. Theologians attempt to maintain the 
purity or truth of their research within certain limits - although these limits 
may be relative rather than absolute, because it seems likely that the further 
from the 'norm' Christian theology deviates, the less effective it is. If 
theologians pay no attention to the quality control aspect of their work, they 
may cease to be Christian theologians. </p>

<p>The Bible, or creeds such as the Apostles' Creed, are yardsticks or standards 
by which we test the purity of any theology. But theology is a human enterprise, 
and no one theologian can be dogmatic about his own work. He can point to the 
evidence and compare it with the 'standards,' but with humility he must realize 
the limits of his own vision. Theology, like science, is both an individual and 
a community affair. Orthodoxy or the 'scientific consensus of opinion' is a 
vector which results from the tension between the liberal and the conservative 
Christian. Between the liberal and the conservative there is a whole spectrum of 
belief, the total sum of which represents the Church.</p>

<p>If this is the approach of both science and theology to the problem of truth, 
what can Bishop Robinson mean by intellectual dishonesty? It might be that there 
are still people on earth who do not believe that man shall someday safely reach 
the moon. This is not my own belief, however, and I believe that the evidence 
suggests that we shall soon place a man on the moon. It is quite probable that 
we shall reach the moon by 1970, and even more probable that we shall reach it 
by 1980. </p>

<p>Is any person intellectually dishonest who now doubts that we shall ever 
reach the moon? Not necessarily. A third world war, or some scientific barrier 
yet unseen, might make the trip impossible, so that it is by no means yet proved 
that we shall reach the moon. Suppose, however, that we do place a man on the 
moon by 1970, and suppose that in 1971 there are still well-informed people who 
do not believe that we shall ever succeed in placing a man on the moon. We would 
say not only that these persons are intellectually dishonest, but that they may 
well have some psychological disorder. </p>

<p>They cannot distinguish between truth and falsehood. I think Bishop Robinson 
is arguing (although he does not say so in these words) that the evidence in 
regard to the Ascension of Christ is so clear that those who continue to include 
the Ascension among their beliefs are doing so against the facts. But the 
existence of flying saucers could very well throw Robinson's 'facts' into grave 
doubt. Just as we have not yet reached the moon. I do not believe that we have 
reached the point where we can announce to the world that the Ascension did not 
happen as it is recorded in Acts 1. </p>

<p>While I have generally been arguing in favor of belief in the Ascension, I must point out that there is value in doubting it. Robinson may be doing the Church a considerable service by doubting the Ascension, in a roundabout way. If a person cannot doubt, he cannot be a Christian any more than he can be a Christian if he cannot believe. The Middle Ages suffered from corruption and superstition largely because people were too gullible. Doubt works as a tremendous purifying force, although, carried to an extreme, as with the philosophy of Rene Descartes (who even doubted his own existence), doubt can lead to a blind alley. But if a person cannot doubt, he may be led to believe in many false theologies and false Christ. (Matthew 24:24)</p>

<p>Bishop Robinson has a right to doubt a realistic interpretation of the Ascension of Christ. Michael Polanyi, in his Personal Knowledge, has shown that scientific truth emerges in the tension between the belief of a scientist in a particular theory and the doubt of another scientist about it. (18) The truth about the Ascension will be arrived at only by the exercise of our ability to seek, doubt, and believe.</p>

<p>Thus in this book we shall be concerned about whether or not flying saucers 
exist, how long they have been with us, and what possible relation flying 
saucers may have to the Bible. But we are concerned with other things as well: 
the way in which our hypothesis concerning the Bible and flying saucers fits 
into current theological debate, and to some extent the problem of scientific 
method and the problem of truth. If we keep these problems in mind, we can 
partially understand why even the suggestion of a relation between the Bible and 
flying saucers seems ridiculous - which it may be. </p>

<p>Finally, we shall be concerned with any possible relation between the Bible 
and modern views of the structure of space, as suggested by Einstein's theory of 
relativity. Does the idea of the 'curvature' of space have any bearing on the 
Biblical idea of 'heaven'? In this book we are going to explore the Bible and 
the space age. We do not know how 'true' the various hypotheses we are 
presenting may prove to be. But it is our impression that the relation between 
the Biblical view of space and our modern scientific view of space is by no 
means settled. A demythologized theology has confined Biblical studies to the 
surface of a sphere - earth. But now we have moved up, into the third dimension; 
and science has even moved into the 'fourth dimension.' I believe that the 
situation is extremely open; I see very little in modern science which excludes 
most of the Biblical beliefs about space. The space age has set us free to 
explore the Bible in a new way.</p>
