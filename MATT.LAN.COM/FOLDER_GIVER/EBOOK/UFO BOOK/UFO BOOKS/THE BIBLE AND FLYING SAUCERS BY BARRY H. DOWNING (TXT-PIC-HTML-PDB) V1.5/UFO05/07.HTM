Dr. Barry H. Downing</p>

<p>On January 5, Rod Serling narrated an NEC special television program, 'In search of Ancient Astronauts.' To many viewers this program undoubtedly seemed like the work of a science fiction writer, who somehow imagines that everything unusual in the world is the work of ancient astronauts from outer space who visited the planet earth thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>Rod Serling was not reporting science fiction - at least not intentionally. This program was based on the book, 'Chariots of the Gods?' by Erich von Daniken, a best selling book in Europe which has had little previous attention in the United States.</p>

<p>On the basis of the work of astronomer Harlow Shapley, von Daniken estimates that there are '100,000,000 planets on which we can speculate that life exists.' Among these, perhaps 100,000 contain civilizations more advanced than our own. Willy Ley, a scientific writer, suggests there may be 18,000 inhabited planets in the Milky Way alone.</p>

<p>Although our present-day space ships would not permit us to travel very far or very fast in space, who knows what our space travel might be like in 10,000 years - if civilization survives that long von Daniken speculates that space travel may be as commonplace on other planets as driving to the supermarket is for us, and if so, maybe spacemen have come to earth.</p>

<p>Among the signs left behind on earth by ancient interplanetary civilizations, argues von Daniken, are the Piri Reis maps, named after a Turkish Navy Admiral to whom they once belonged. These maps date back to almost the time of Christ, and yet represent the shape of the earth as if they were photographs from outer space taken by an Apollo rocket.</p>

<p>According to an expert cartographer the maps outline exactly the mountain ranges in the Antarctic which were not discovered by explorers until 1952. These maps could only have been drawn with knowledge gained in the Twentieth Century, and yet they are hundreds of years old.</p>

<p>It is in ancient religious symbols that von Daniken finds some of his most interesting material. Many primitive people have legends of gods who came down from the sky in fiery chariots - from whence he derives the title of his book. Bible students will remember that Elijah was taken off into the sky in a 'chariot of fire' (2 Kings 2:11).</p>

<p>Von Daniken has found paintings of god-like spacemen on walls of caves in Tibet; hand carved beings with 'halos' may have on some kind of space suit head gear. He wonders how Stonehenge in England was built, about the giant carvings on Easter Island, and about what appears to be an ancient airstrip in Peru. Whether all of these archaeological oddities can be explained as either the work of or inspired by ancient astronauts, is doubtful.</p>

<p>But von Daniken is right in saying that it does not make sense in our present understanding of 'primitive man' to see him either able or likely to build many of our usual ancient monuments without some type of external stimulation. The wonder of these monuments is much more impressive in Rod Serlings TV review than in von Daniken's book, so I suggest viewing it if it is re-run.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in the religious implications of von Daniken's work. At the same time his book was published in Europe, my book, The Bible and Flying Saucers,' was published in the United States. In some ways von Daniken and I agree, but in some important ways we do not, particularly in regard to the problem of ancient astronauts and religion.</p>

<p>I agree with von Daniken that ancient astronauts, or at least beings from a Higher Civilization (which the Bible calls Heaven), influenced the Biblical religion. For von Daniken, however, this influence was accidental, while in my opinion this influence was deliberate.</p>

<p>The Serling TV broadcast began by showing some primitive natives in an underdeveloped part of the world gathered in apparent worship around a straw airplane model they had constructed. The narrator pointed out that during World War 2 our Air Force built an air strip for bombers to land and refuel near the native village.</p>

<p>To these primitive people, the TV program suggested, we seemed like gods who came down from the sky and returned to the sky, whom the natives now worship. In other words, the new religion of the natives is an ACCIDENTAL product of our visit to the native jungle.</p>

<p>The central event of the Old Testament is the Exodus, and the key to the Exodus is something that appears in many ways like a space ship, some kind of UFO, described as a 'pillar of cloud by day and pillar of fire by night.' (Exodus 13:21,22). This UFO is called the Angel of God, it appears to Moses in the middle of the burning bush, and is given credit for bringing all the plagues on the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The pillar of cloud then leads the Israelites up to the Red Sea, using its power to split the sea letting the Israelites through, only to turn off the power and let the walls of water fall on the Egyptians (Exodus 14:19-30). This UFO drops manna to feed the Jews in the wilderness, leads the Jews up to Mount Sinai, gives Moses not only the Ten Commandments, but all the commandments of the Jewish religion.</p>

<p>It is very clear from the Exodus story that if the Hebrew people were in contact with what von Daniken calls 'ancient astronauts,' then the Jewish religion is not an accidental misinterpretation of 'gods in the sky' by the Jews, but rather these 'gods' or 'angels' have given the Jews a religion in the laboratory of the wilderness ON PURPOSE.</p>

<p>I do not think von Daniken knows the Bible very well, because while he suggests that the Ark of the Covenant (carried during the Exodus) was electrically charged, he never mentions the pillar of cloud and fire. Perhaps he just could not face up to the implications of the idea that the Jewish religion was deliberately caused by beings from another world.</p>

<p>The implications for the Christian religion are equally serious. Jesus said of himself, 'you are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world' (John 8:23).</p>

<p>Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, which in the Bible means he was one of the angels. He had contact with beings from another world at different times in his life, but perhaps most important the Bible says beings from another world were at the empty tomb on Easter, and had something to do with the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.</p>

<p>The space age is forcing us to ask the question: Is it possible the Old Testament and New Testament religions were DELIBERATELY brought about by beings from another world? This is a fearful question, but it is also a hopeful one. Von Daniken thinks the Biblical religion is an accidental byproduct of primitive contact with ancient astronauts. I think the Biblical religion is the deliberate work of ancient astronauts, or at least of Higher Beings.</p>

<p>But if I am right, where have these Beings gone? I think they are still here, still watching the progress of their Religion. That is what the modern UFO problem is about - those ancient astronauts are still there, still watching.</p>

<p>I have given dozens of talks on my book in the Triple Cities, and have had many people tell me about their UFO sightings after my talk. There are probably thousands of people in Broome County who have seen UFOs, although they may be afraid to admit it.</p>

<p>When I talked to Vestal Rotary Club, a man told me about watching a UFO through his telescope from his backyard with friends. It was first spotted hovering over the Tri-Cities Airport, then moved over the Broome County Airport. He said the telescope clearly showed the wings on the planes landing at Broome County. But the UFO had no wings, and it gave off a light (visible even during the day) which alternated between orange and pure white.</p>

<p>After giving a talk to a Methodist Church in Vestal a former Air Force man related his experience during the Korean War. He flew with a reconnaissance plane at night to lead bombing missions over the North. The North Korean MIGs did not have the technology to fight at night, but the men feared that technology would soon be developed, and then the bombers would be defenseless.</p>

<p>One night, a pie shape blotted out on the plane's radar, and looking back all the men saw a bright light behind them. They all thought the MIGs had a new technology, and that they were dead. But then the UFO caught up with them, flew above them, and finally beside them. These were all men experienced with air phenomena. They had never seen anything like it before. The next day the members of the bomber crew were all talking about the experience - about 150 men had seen the UFO.</p>

<p>Although many do not agree with him, the scientist and former Air Force UFO consultant, Dr. J. Alien Hynek, has written a book, The UFO Experience,' which concludes that we are now being watched by beings from another world.</p>

<p>I cannot prove it, but I think we are still being watched by those 'ancient astronauts,' the ones who started the Biblical religion. As we become more conscious of this other worldly reality watching us, we will have to begin to ask: Why did they start the Biblical religion? What happens to our idea of faith?</p>

<p>These are hard questions, but they will be the questions of years to come. All religious questions are hard questions, that is why faith is hard. Erich von Daniken's ancient astronauts are going to force us to look at the Bible in a new way, even more than von Daniken knows!</p>
