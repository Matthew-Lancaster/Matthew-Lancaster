<p>The degree of probability of my hypothesis depends on (i) the probability of the existence of flying saucers (which transport beings from another world to ours) and (2) the probability that these space vehicles are the same ones the Bible describes as having been pivotal in the development of the Biblical religion.</p>

<p>Do flying saucers exist? We must keep in mind with Michael Polanyi that this is both a personal and a factual question. A person becomes a 'believer' in UFOs on the basis of a certain amount of evidence which convinces him that he must choose to believe rather than doubt. A person who doubts that UFOs exist might be a person who almost always doubts everything; such a person might have been heard saying fifteen years ago, 'We will never send a man to the moon." He may still be saying so today. On the other hand, the 'believer' may be a very gullible person - he may believe in astrology (which I do not), or at a very advanced age he may still believe in Santa Claus. Some persons are more open to belief; others, to doubt. </p>

<p>Some people are extremely skeptical about some things, while simultaneously being gullible about others. The 'degree of probability' which I emotionally feel about the existence of UFOs is 70 per cent belief and 30 per cent doubt, or something on that order. What I believe however, does not alter the facts: saucers either exist or do not exist. Modern weather information sometimes suggests that There is a '10 per cent probability of rain or snow'; probably it will not rain - but then it might. I am suggesting here the degree of probability that Jesus ascended into space in a UFO which looked like a modern flying saucer.</p>

<p>Part of the reason it will be difficult for the average person to believe that Jesus ascended into space in some sort of vehicle is that very few people today understand or accept the Biblical view of angels. What is clear throughout the Biblical material, however, is that God's will for the Jews, and eventually for all mankind, was 'revealed' by beings from another world. Usually these beings looked very much like ordinary human beings (they almost never have wings); God made man 'for a little while lower than the angels' (Hebrews 2:7), a 'little while' because eventually men become angels, or like angels in the resurrection world (Matthew 22:30). It was to the resurrection world, the world of angels, that Christ returned at the Ascension (Acts 1:9). Tyro men, from another world were present at the scene of the Ascension to explain to the disciples the significance of what they had just witnessed Acts 1:10,11). </p>

<p>Few can read the Bible without getting the distinct impression that the Biblical religion - in both the Old and the New Testaments - was a religion which was delivered to a select group of people by beings from another world. Once the 'package' of the Biblical religion had been delivered, man became responsible for the distribution of the contents of the package. </p>

<p>When I say that the 'package' of the Biblical religion was delivered, I do not mean to imply that the Bible is that package. The Biblical people 'digested' the contents of the package, much as John 'ate' the heavenly scroll (Revelation 10:10). The Bible contains witnessed and digested revelation, but it is important to remember that not everything recorded in the Bible was a revelation from beings from another world. The Bible also records family history, wars, rulers, and church history. But the heart of the Biblical religion was a 'package' from heaven finally embodied in Jesus himself. The Greek word for angel means a messenger; thus the word angel is an essential functional description. </p>

<p>A person who preached the gospel was called an evangelist, and the Greek word, like the English word, contains the word angel - ev-angel-ist. The disciples themselves became 'angels' the sense that they became messengers preaching Christ in strange worlds. Christ was the package, and the elements of bread and wine were distributed by the 'evangelists' as the Eucharist. At the Ascension the parting instructions of Christ to his disciples were to preach the gospel in all the world (Acts 1:8). They had been given the riches of the gospel, and they became the stewards of the gospel. Just as America with her riches has responded to a starving world by sending Care packages, so the disciples were commissioned to take their riches, the bread of heaven, and distribute it in a spiritually poor world. Jesus had three words for Peter: Feed my sheep (John 21:17).</p>

<p>Thus the question of whether or not flying saucers exist is not merely a question of whether we are being visited by beings from another world. It is possible that these beings who are watching us are the very same beings who stimulated the Biblical religion. Jesus gave the impression that the 'angels' are very much concerned about the success of the gospel on earth; he went so far as to say that 'there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents' (Luke 15:10). Angels seem to be emotionally as well as actively involved in the success or failure of the gospel. One may very well wonder, if these angels are so concerned about the success of the gospel, why they do not take a more obviously active part in 'evangelism.' </p>

<p>If a UFO landed in the White House lawn, and a being from another world emerged and proceeded to make a world-wide television broadcast urging people to accept the Biblical religion perhaps several con-versions would follow. But if we are now being watched by beings from another world - the same beings who initiated the Biblical religion - then it seems clear that they are following a general laissez-faire policy. The gospel aims to have men become 'children of God' (John 1:12) that is, mature, responsible sons. It could certainly be argued that since Biblical times we have been weaned from the milk on which the Church began - we have had to survive on strong meat in the past few centuries, not without problems of indigestion. We have been allowed to wage our wars and build our concentration camps; we have had to sink or swim in world affairs.</p>

<p>In the twelfth chapter of the book of Acts we read that Herod placed Peter in prison, and the night before Peter was to have been killed, an angel came and let Peter out of prison. </p>

<p>Because he was asleep when the angel arrived, Peter thought that the whole sequence was a dream, but the angel led him out into the street and then departed from him. Peter was still dazed, but he decided that he might as well walk 'to the house of Mary,' and Luke suggests that a girl by the name of Rhoda was so shocked to hear Peter's voice that she forgot to open the door. One significant fact about this passage is that the angel did not linger. He came, did his job, and left immediately. He did not go with Peter and stay for a midnight snack. One does not get the impression on reading the Bible that one could go into any coffee shop on main street in Jerusalem and find an angel. If a situation was really desperate, an angel might move in to save it. But as soon as his job was finished, he got out of the way of the Church Angels did not usually interfere. They did not save Stephen, and apparently Peter was martyred later at Rome. The main point at this time is that if we are being watched rather than contacted by beings from another world who initiated the Biblical religion, it appears consistent with their policy of remaining aloof from our historical situation whenever possible.</p>

<p><b>Angels In History</b></p>

<p>There have been essentially two ideas of angels which have dominated Western thinking - the Biblical and the Greek. While some Greek angels bore resemblance to human beings, the Greeks also developed the concept of the soul which was in many ways similar to a geometric point. One gets the impression in Plato's Timaeus and Aristotle's Physica that the human soul is analogous to a geometric point and that it is from the concept of the point that geometry is derived - geometry representing an uncontaminated form of pure thought. (1) Centuries later this concept of the geometric point-soul serves as a similar basis for the monads of Leibniz. The Greeks believed that the human soul had its origin in the point-stars on the outer sphere of the universe, and at death the human soul escaped from its body to return to the geo-metric-soul-point-star in space from which it had originally come. Astrology arose directly from this world view. Angels that were like points were therefore basically invisible, and the Greeks often used these angels as an explanation of the invisible 'cause' behind events. Before the discovery of the laws of momentum, an angel might cause a stone to fall or the sun to go around the earth.</p>

<p>In the Bible, however, angels are essentially humanlike beings that have come from 'above,' from another world out in space. They are not usually invisible although the sequence with Balaam's ass (Numbers 22:21 ff.) may be an exception. The Bible, particularly the New Testament, develops the concept of the resurrection of the body, in which men become like angels, in direct contrast to the Greek view in which only man's soul is saved (and his body lost). The Biblical world view presents such a problem in the face of modern science because it stresses the resurrection of the body - and presumably bodies must occupy some place in space. Where? If we were committed to the Greek view of salvation, then we could say that eternal life is merely a 'state' since a point-soul has essentially no spatial properties, or at least spatial dimensions. </p>

<p>As the gospel was preached in the Greek world the two divergent views of angels and salvation were mixed in the evolution of Christian doctrine. By the time we reach Thomas Aquinas in the mid-thirteenth century, we find that Aquinas in the Treatise on Angels' in his Summa Theologica can wonder about the size of angels in comparison with a pin. (2) The answer depends on whether one is thinking of Biblical or Greek angels. Aquinas defined angels as pure 'soul' beings, without the bodies of men. In the Bible we do not find that the basic difference between man and angels is that man has a body; both have bodies. The difference is that man is from earth; angels come from another world.</p>

<p>When Copernicus and Galileo shattered the celestial spheres of Ptolemy, the eschatology of Aquinas and of the Christian Church as a whole suffered. The Reformation attempted with some success to separate Biblical theology from Greek philosophy, and there was some revival of a Biblical view of angels. Isaac Newton, who devoted at least as much time to his Protestant theology as he did to his science, was thoroughly committed to a belief in Biblical angels, in the resurrection of the body, and in a 'heaven' somewhere in outer space. He was, in both his science and his theology, thoroughly against 'vain philosophy,' as he called it; that is, he was against Aristotle.</p>

<p>As the scientific revolution continued, however, and the age of Darwinian evolution emerged, it no longer seemed possible for a scientist to be committed to the Biblical world view. The concept of evolution, together with the science of genetics, was based in part on the idea of 'chance,' and as scientists surveyed man's environment, they concluded that it was by pure chance, a freak accident of the universe, that man ever appeared. When all the atmospheric conditions, temperature conditions, gravitational forces, rotation rate of the earth - to name a few of the factors involved in sustaining Me - were considered, it seemed that the earth was probably the only place in the universe with life. Man was alone in a vast, impersonal machine. Like a little boy lost in a wood, we began to whistle a 'happy' tune to pretend that we were not afraid. Men of science and literature began asking man to grow up and face his destiny. Out of this mentality arose the idea of progress and the social gospel. We are asked to 'demythologize' the primitive Biblical religion; we must mature; we must grow up.</p>

<p>But as the twentieth century continued, so did scientific advance. During World War II we moved into the air with our planes and with radar; the Germans developed the principle of the rocket, and with the war past, the space age began. As we moved into space with rockets, planes, radar, and radio telescopes, our world view began to change. We began to think seriously again about a universe with many inhabitants, and we began looking for life from other worlds. We were no longer confined in our thinking to our two-dimensional demythologized earth. We broke through the space barrier; we became aware again of our three-dimensional universe. </p>

<p>Was there life on Mars or Venus? Science fiction came forth with all sorts of imaginative answers, but even a measured scientific view based again on 'chance' or probability suggested that because of the vast size of our universe, there may be millions of inhabited planets even within our own Milky Way. Many well-informed scientists began to suspect that other races might have evolved in the course of time, and that long ago other beings might have attempted to travel in space - perhaps even to our earth.</p>

<p>At the end of World War II, as we moved into space, we began to see 'Unidentified Flying Objects,' objects which many thought were space vehicles from another world which were watching us. Bishop Robinson's Honest to God is based on Rudolf Bultmann's demythologizing principles, which were in turn based on the science Bultmann learned at the beginning of the twentieth century, before the space age began. Is it possible that Robinson's Honest to God is based on scientific thinking which is now out of date?</p>

<p>Not only has 'demythologizing' kept us from thinking seriously about angels, but also we have not thoroughly separated the Biblical from the Greek view of angels. Scientific method seeks to explain reality in terms of the testable, and the Greek 'invisible' soul-point angels are untestable. As J. Bronowski has said in The Common Sense of Science,</p>

<p>As much as bookkeeping, government and doing the weekend shopping, science is an activity of putting order into our experience. So much was true even of the science of Aquinas. To this was added in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a new assumption about the kind of order which science sets out to find or make. Roughly, the assumption amounts to this, that science is to get rid of angels, blue fairies with red noses, and other agents whose intervention would reduce the explanation of physical events to other than physical terms. The world is regular in itself; the world is a machine. (3)</p>

<p>In a certain sense I agree with Bronowski that the task of science is to get rid of angels or 'blue fairies' as explanations of natural phenomena. Thus I do not believe that angels keep the earth turning on its axis; I believe that the earth's momentum keeps it rotating. Science seeks to find the cause for the visible effect. Bronowski does not consider angels a legitimate cause; but we have to ask, What is the cause of the Biblical religion? We know the effect. It is recorded in Scriptures. The demythologizers would say that the basic cause behind the Biblical religion is psychological: it is a religion man has synthesized because of certain Inner needs. But the Scriptures give as their own cause the suggestion" that beings from another world -angels - were the external agent which caused the Hebrew-Christian tradition. In the space age I do not think we are compelled to believe that this explanation is necessarily mythological, although of course it could be. </p>

<p>To give a human analogy, I should think that if some of our astronauts were sent to another planet, and they were to discover a primitive people, and if these astronauts were specifically instructed to lead these people to a particular religious commitment, they might very well succeed. These primitive people might record the fact that beings from another world caused the birth of their religion. In this instance I would request that Bronowski make an exception to his general rule of not admitting angels into his scientific explanation of things, for to exclude angels would be to exclude at least the clue to the correct explanation. I would also ask theological demythologizers to be more willing to admit that the original source of religious beliefs may have been external to man's psyche.</p>

<p>One might well argue that it is scientifically improbable that such a sequence of events would take place, but I cannot think of grounds on which such an explanation is automatically scientifically out of the question, providing that we separate the Biblical from the Greek way of thinking about angels. It is on these grounds that I think Bishop Robinson is wrong in suggesting that it is dishonest for Christians to go on believing in the Ascension of Christ. Bishop Robinson has the right to maintain that the Ascension is highly improbable, but it is by no means impossible in the light of present scientific thinking, particularly if one provides Christ with an adequate space vehicle. One may not be pleased with the theological implications of the suggestion that Christ ascended in some sort of space vehicle; but the implications fit the evidence better than the suggestion that there was no Ascension at all.</p>

<p>If flying saucers exist, if they are in fact space vehicles from another world, and if they have the performance capabilities described in various UFO reports, then there is no doubt that these vehicles would have provided adequate transportation for any beings who might have been involved in nourishing the Biblical religion. We have become aware of these UFOs only since our move into space during and after World War II. If we had not moved into space, perhaps we would not have noticed them even yet. At present these UFOs seem to be Interested mainly in surveillance, not in making contact. Who can say that these being have not been maintaining surveillance for the past four thousand years? The possibility stretches the imagination, but it cannot be ruled out a priori. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that there are not several groups of beings, perhaps from many different worlds, watching us, as we might watch fish in a pond.</p>

<p><b>The UFO Controversy</b></p>

<p>The whole question of the existence of UFOs will not be settled until the U.S. Air Force makes all its space surveillance facilities available to some independent organization for a thorough investigation. A recent newspaper article, headlined 'Air Force Plans "Flying Saucers" Probe,' said that 'the Air Force is trying to get a leading university to investigate some episodes in depth.' The reason for the investigation is that there have been 'widespread charges that the Air Force was concealing the truth lest there be a panic.' (4) The Government has since 'hired the University of Colorado, whose Dr. Edward U. Condon will direct a study project which will involve more than 100 scientists down here to determine who's up there. The idea behind all this is to get the Air Force off the spot and convince the public that earthlings are in no great danger from what are officially known as UFOs,' according to the New York Daily News. (5)</p>

<p>Who has been charging that members of the Air Force have concealed the truth? A number of persons have led the assault, but certainly one of the first, Major Donald E. Keyhoe, who has written a number of well-documented books, including Flying Saucers from Outer Space, Flying Saucers Are Real, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, and Flying Saucers: Top Secret. Keyhoe has also headed the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena which has compiled the work The UFO Evidence. In The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, published in 1955, Keyhoe outlined the program of a 'conspiracy' of silence on the part of the U.S. Air Force personnel to keep UFO information from the public. </p>

<p>Other books, such as Anatomy of a Phenomenon by Jacques Vallee and Report on Unidentified Flying Objects by Captain Edward Ruppelt, together with the recent Flying Saucers -Serious Business by Frank Edwards, have tended to support Keyhoe's thesis that members of the Air Force have concealed evidence concerning UFOs from the public. Most UFO authors are convinced that flying saucers either contain beings from another world or that they are remote-con-trolled spaceships from another planet. But there seems to Be no concensus as to what the beings may look like or where they may have come from, although speculation of course abounds. I am not going to attempt a detailed summary of the various UFO books, but I shall bring out some points which are important for Biblical studies.</p>

<p>According to Keyhoe, Air Force pilots are under restrictions not to give out information to the public concerning UFO contacts. I wrote to the Air Force concerning the UFO situation and received in the mail what was described as 'The current report on Project Blue Book,' which dealt with material up to 1965. In this report the following comment appears: "The Air Force does not deny the possibility that some form of life may exist on other planets in the universe. However, to date, the Air Force has neither received nor discovered any evidence which proves the existence of intra-space mobility of extraterrestrial life.' </p>

<p>The following paragraph adds, however, 'Anyone observing what he considers to be an unidentified flying object should report it to the nearest Air Force Base,' (6) The Air Force position seems clear. They deny having 'proof that UFOs from another world exist. I have already discussed the nature of scientific 'proof hi terms of what may be called 'probability,' and no scientist ever claims that he has absolute 'proof of anything. He may, however, have very convincing evidence. I cannot help wondering if, while the Air Force does not have 'proof,' it may in fact have considerable evidence that UFOs from another world exist. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I cannot help wondering why members of the Air Force are anxious to carry on their UFO program if they have 'no evidence.' The report encourages the individual to report UFO sightings to the nearest Air Force base. 'Project Blue Book' began eighteen years ago. If members of the Air Force really believe that UFOs do not exist, why after eighteen years do they still want sightings to be reported?</p>

<p>The Air Force report also included the indication of some of the restrictions concerning UFOs. The following items are for internal use only and are not available for distribution to the public. These concern internal management and procedures for forwarding UFO reports to the appropriate agency: 1. Air Force Regulation 200-2; 2. JANAP 146;3. UFO Project Record Card.' (7) Some of these restrictions apparently impose fines or courts-martial on Air Force personnel for disclosing UFO information. (8)</p>

<p>Several years ago I talked with a U.S. Air Force pilot who received a call from a ground radar station while he was flying his F-84 Sabre Jet over Vermont. The radar station had spotted a blip on the screen which it could not identify, and the pilot was asked to check it out - a fairly routine assignment. The pilot told me that as he closed in on the silvery 1 metallic object, it suddenly accelerated away from him, and 8 he could not catch it, despite the fact that he was flying the fastest jet in production at that time. He was convinced that the UFO was a spaceship from another world. Fortunately, I do not know his name, for I do not think that he was sup-posed to disclose this information. </p>

<p>I have, of course, no way of knowing that the pilot was telling me the truth. But this contact was personally important for me because it tended to support what men such as Keyhoe and Edwards maintain; that is, that it is Air Force personnel who have the only overall picture of the UFO situation. Any UFO investigation by the University of Colorado without the full cooperation of the Air Force can hardly be complete.</p>

<p>Frank Edwards made the following statement in his book Flying Saucers - Serious Business:</p>

<p>One night early in October of 1965, I addressed an audience of radar experts who had hired me, at their own expense, to come and tell them all that I could about the ubiquitous Unidentified Flying Objects. These were the men (Air Traffic Controllers) who see these things on their radar screens. These are the same men who are required by regulation to give out prefabricated answers or 'explanations' to all who make inquiry about such things.</p>

<p>Why were they paying me, a civilian newsman, to tell them about things they see more frequently than anyone else in the nation?</p>

<p>The reason was simple: Although they were under the Federal Aviation Agency, that agency refused to answer their queries for information on the UFO's. (9) Thus, even individual members of the Air Force network who have contact with UFOs do not have the total picture; only the few men at the top of Project Blue Book can see the whole UFO landscape. Any university investigation which hopes to succeed will need to share this view 'from the top.' There are two reasons why it is for the 'good of our nation' to keep UFO information secret, (i) There is the fear of public panic, and the possible economic crisis on the stock market. (2) </p>

<p>If UFOs exist, and are space vehicles from another world, they seem to operate according to some anti-gravitational principle. Donald Keyhoe devotes one chapter of his Flying Saucer Conspiracy to the 'Anti-G Field,' and Edwards and others seem to agree that some anti-gravitational (anti-G) force is at work in UFOs. The nation which discovers the secret of anti-gravitational propulsion will have made a breakthrough at least as important as the development of atomic energy, and therefore anti-G information in connection with UFOs would be Top Secret.' (10) I am not qualified to speak concerning the validity of the anti-gravitation hypothesis in regard to UFOs, but given the suggestion that an anti-G field is associated with modern UFOs, we shall discover some fantastic consequences for Biblical studies, especially when we examine the parting of the 'Red Sea' during the Exodus.</p>

<p>I cannot prove whether or not UFOs exist. The whole issue must be settled by the very few men who are in a position to collect and evaluate the data. There are at present two schools of thought concerning UFOs: the one which the Air Force maintains - either honestly or dishonestly - that UFOs do not exist, at least in the sense that they are space craft from another world; and the other position of Keyhoe. Edwards, and others that UFOs or flying saucers do exist and that they are under the control of beings from another world. </p>

<p>A typical newspaper report of a UFO sighting is as follows:</p>

<p>Two Erie [Pa.] newsmen said they saw and photographed early today a bright object in the sky near where a young couple reported the landing of a mysterious object.</p>

<p>Dennis Buckel of radio station WJET said at about 2 a.m. he saw what looked like a bright star moving fast.</p>

<p>Another WJET newsman, Jerry Trembley, said he saw the same object about two hours later and another cluster of flashing lights.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Betty Jean Klem, 16, of Jamestown, N.Y., and Douglas Tibbets, 18, of Greenhurst N.Y., said they saw a metallic, silvery object land near their car on a beach in Presque Isle State Park, a peninsula jutting into Lake Erie. Police said they found two triangular impressions in the sand, about 6 inches deep. The WJET newsmen came up with motion pictures of objects in the sky. (11)</p>

<p>This particular report does not mention the shape of the UFO, although many are of course described as saucer shaped. But the objects usually seem to give off light, travel at high speed, and are 'silvery' in appearance. One can argue that the observers were not qualified, or that the motion pictures were faked, or that they in fact saw an artificial satellite - which does not, of course, account for the triangular impressions in the sand. Many UFO sightings never are printed. This one was printed because, although there may be doubt as to what was seen, several separate witnesses reported seeing a strange object; there seems to be a good possibility that something strange was seen.</p>

<p><b>Flying Saucers And Demythologizing</b></p>

<p>If flying saucers do exist, and if proof of their existence is eventually established, theologians attempting to develop a realistic Biblical interpretation will have one good historic example of how 'demythologizers' have drawn premature conclusions. Anyone who accepts the Air Force position regarding UFOs assumes that flying saucers are a mythological or psychological construction of a group of 'gullible' or mentally unbalanced people.</p>

<p>If we take as an example reporting which supports the Air Force position, a series of Time magazine articles exemplify what I have in mind. The well-known UFO sighting near Ann Arbor, Michigan, in March of 1966 was reported in the April 1 issue of Time, which included in its report a comment from a three-year-old girl who expected to 'see a spaceman with "green, yellow and orange juice hair."' The sighting was 'a sure sign of primaveral delirium.' The only sign of sanity was that 'Through its Project Blue Book, the Air Force had looked into 10,147 other Unidentified Flying Objects since flying saucers entered American mythology [my italics] in 1947 ... At week's end the Air Force attributed the Ann Arbor and Hillsdale apparitions to marsh gas (methane) created by organic decomposition and ignited by combustion.' (12)</p>

<p>The following issue of Time reported what was called 'The Gullibility Experiment.' Some ingenious Students at Pasadena's California Institute of Technology sent aloft some Brightly lighted balloons at night and numerous UFO reports resulted thus proving how 'gullible' everyone is. (13) I think it fair to point out that it is not every night that students launch lighted balloons into the sky. Furthermore, people were actually seeing something when they made their reports. The students did not make their experiment until nearly two decades after 'flying saucers' were first widely reported. One could very easily, on the basis of the students' experiment, draw the following conclusion: when people see obviously strange UFOs in the sky, they will report them.</p>

<p>As an illustration of how an editor can support his personal convictions, the Ann Arbor report was listed by Time as a 'local' phenomenon under the heading 'Nation,' while the 'Gullibility Experiment' was reported under 'Science.' I would not argue that everything reported as a UFO is in fact a flying saucer. Undoubtedly there is much mythology connected with UFOs, but just as in the gullibility experiment the reports did have some basis in fact, so I am very suspicious that the idea of flying saucers has some basis in fact.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the fact that the 'marsh gas' theory is built on a swampy foundation, the Air Force scientist who put forward the theory was J. Alien Hynek, and he later wrote an article entitled 'Are Flying Saucers Real?' for the December 17, 1966, issue of the Saturday Evening Tost. In this article Hynek confesses that he had very little scientific fact to support his 'swamp gas' conjecture, and he never intended it to be 'the' answer to the Michigan sighting. After learning about swamp gas, Hynek says that he decided 'it was a "possible" explanation I would offer to the reporters.' Hynek apparently did not even believe the explanation himself, and on the basis of the Post article, it is quite clear that Hynek believes the whole UFO problem to be far more complex than the simple 'mythological' explanation such as Time magazine has assumed. (14)</p>

<p>Speaking of gullibility, I think one could as easily argue that Time is hardly showing intelligent skepticism in gleefully reporting the findings of an Air Force-sponsored scientist (the same Air Force which never heard of a U-2) who several days after the Ann Arbor sighting concluded that what was seen by dozens of witnesses - but not by the scientist - was swamp gas.</p>

<p>It does not seem to have occurred to anyone on the Time staff that a flying saucer might actually have been seen; there simply has to be another explanation - the flying-saucer answer is a priori out of the question. Anything -including swamp gas - is a more acceptable answer to those who must 'demythologize' flying saucers. One irony is that the cover of the Time issue which reported the gullibility experiment raised the ominous question in red letters on black, 'Is God Dead?' This issue devotes a considerable amount of space to the 'God is dead' theology, which Time reports is led by 'principally Thomas J.J. Altizer of Emory University' among others. (15) Demythologizing the Biblical material is one of the most important steps in the 'God is dead' theology of Altizer. A scholar who has made pioneering studies concerning the mythological foundations of religion is Mircea Eliade, who has written among other works The Sacred and the Profane. (16)  </p>

<p>Thomas J. J. Altizer was a student of Eliade, and has written the study, Mircea Eliade and the Dialectic of the Sacred. Altizer relies heavily on the psychology of Carl G. Jung, as this work illustrates, and Eliade in works such as Myths, Dreams and Mysteries: The Encounter Between Contemporary Faiths and Archaic Realities also draws insights from the studies of Jung. I mention Jung because we have now come full circle. One of Jung's books is entitled Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies."</p>

<p>Again I would not deny that UFOs, or at least UFO reports, exhibit many 'mythological' characteristics. It does not add to the credibility of a well-reported article by Harold H. Deneault, Jr., entitled 'Anatomy of a UFO Cover-Up,' that the article appears on the cover of Fate magazine sandwiched between two articles under the titles, 'Is Bhajan Singh Reborn in Munesh?' and 'Thumping Poltergeist in California.' (18) Undoubtedly many UFO reports are mythological in origin, but one thing which tends to separate UFOs from poltergeists is the frequency with which they are reported. To my knowledge, the U.S. Air Force has never considered carrying out a twenty-year investigation of poltergeists. Thus the flying-saucer debate is over the question: Do saucers exist, or are they myth? The modern theological debate is over several questions such as: Did Jesus rise from the dead, were 'angels' present at the tomb, did Jesus ascend into space, or is this myth?</p>

<p>If sometime in the future we should finally have sufficient evidence to show beyond reasonable doubt that flying saucers do exist, I believe that this will automatically have important consequences for theology, whether or not modern UFOs have anything to do with the Bible. The demythologized 'honest to God' theology of Robinson and the 'death of God' theology of Altizer are rooted in three basic sciences: psychology, mythology, and philosophy (I use the term 'science' in its broadest sense here). Starting with Bultmann, who assumed that the Biblical people held a 'primitive' cosmology, theologians have then taken studies by men such as Eliade in religious myth and applied them to the Bible. </p>

<p>The cause behind such mythology is interpreted in terms of psychological studies by scholars such as Jung, and theologians such as Bultmann, Robinson, or Altizer then draw from the existential philosophy of thinkers such as Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre to reinterpret the Biblical religion for modern man. There is a fantastic field of scholarship behind this theology which has made a valuable permanent impact on the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The basic question I have in mind, however, is as follows: Have the psychologically oriented existential demythologizers in theology tried to include too much in their world view? In the past we may have confused fact with myth. Are we now confusing myth with fact? By this I mean that this school of theology has built a triangular fortress with mythology, psychology, and existential philosophy serving as the three cornerposts. </p>

<p>This theological fort seems to have contracted a disease similar to suburban sprawl, covering larger and ever larger areas within the triangle until now the point has been reached where these theologians claim that God may be dead. Have they now extended the boundaries of their demythologized theological fort too far? If they have, how can this be demonstrated? Suppose that Jung is wrong in his assumption that flying saucers are an example of a modern myth of things seen in the skies. This would mean that even such an eminent psychologist as Jung does not always know a myth when he sees one. If Jung is wrong about flying saucers, then the 'psychological' and 'mythological' cornerposts of demythologized Christianity may be shaken. </p>

<p>The 'existential' post depends on the other two posts for its strength. If the other posts retreat, the existential post will follow. The Bible suggests that Jesus 'ascended' in some sort of UFO. Theologians and psychologists can explain everything from the 'Ascension of Christ' to 'flying saucers' in terms of 'myth.' But if flying saucers exist, then perhaps we can again argue for a realistic interpretation of the Ascension of Christ (honestly). Suppose that in a remote and primitive tribe of people somewhere on earth a native ran excitedly into his village and reported to his chief that he had just seen floating down from the sky an 'angel' suspended beneath a great white sheet. The chief might call a council meeting, and the tribal 'psychologist' might suggest that the reporter of the UFO had suffered a hallucination; the 'demythologizer' would agree in part, but he would go on to say that this 'myth' of a man floating down from the sky represents the reporter's psychological need to make contact with the transcendent and that he has given this need an external mythological expression. </p>

<p>The 'existentialist,' once he had heard the analysis of the psychologist and the demythologizer, would go on to reassure the reporter that while he did not actually see a man floating down from the sky, nevertheless this myth could be given an existential interpretation from which the whole tribe could benefit, for in this way all could gain insight into their 'ground of being.' If the 'medicine man' in the tribe (realistic or empiricist theologian) had not spoken by this time, he would be well advised not to speak, for he is outnumbered three to one. But the medicine man might gain courage if a stranger carrying a parachute were then to wander into camp. If flying saucers do exist, and if we finally gain sufficient evidence of their existence to put the issue beyond doubt, then I dare say that the course of theology may be radically changed. If flying saucers do not exist, then much theology will probably continue its present course which leads down the road to the death of God. </p>

<p>I am writing this book on the assumption that future evidence will point to the existence of flying saucers, but only time will put the question beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>A good synthesis of the psychological, existential, and mythological studies of our time is found in Thomas J. J. Altizer's Mircea Eliade and the Dialectic of the Sacred. The 'dialectic' about which Altizer speaks is between the sacred and the profane, which is roughly a dialectic between opposites, the mythological (sacred) and material (profane). To link flying saucers with the religious, of course, shatters the dialectic which Altizer wishes to establish, for it is quite likely that UFOs are material, not mythological. If flying saucers are material, there is for Altizer no way that they could be sacred. In his volume on Eliade we can see almost all the significant forces which have molded modern theology simultaneously at work. In his 'Introduction' Altizer announces that:</p>

<p>the moment has arrived to engage in a radical quest for a new mode of religious understanding. The first requirement of such a quest is a forthright confession of the death of God of Christendom, a full acknowledgment that the era of Christian civilization has come to an end, with the result that all cognitive meaning and all moral values that were once historically associated with the Christian God have collapsed. Furthermore, we must recognize that the death of God is a historical event: God has died in our time, in our history, in our existence. Insofar as we live in our destiny, we can know neither a trace of God's presence nor an image of his reality. (19)</p>

<p>The Christian God is meaningless for most persons in the twentieth century both intellectually and morally. But the question must be raised: Does the fault lie with God (being either dead or nonexistent), or does the fault lie with us, with the fact that our modem 'scientific world view' has kept us from understanding the Biblical God realistically? Altizer has turned to Eliade as a source for a new understanding of the sacred because the Christian understanding is dead. Eliade has done his best work with Eastern religions, especially with Indian and Greek thought. The orientation of Eliade's thought is toward the soul, mind, or psyche. The soul is the seat of the sacred; the world is profane and, so far as the soul is caught up in worldliness, it is caught up in the profane. Modern science is grounded in 'worldlines,' and there is throughout Altizer's work a hostility toward science, which is extremely significant. Thus Altizer, like Eliade, 'has long been attracted to Jung, while maintaining a bitter hostility toward Freud. Eliade objects to Freud's ideology, to his positivist understanding of "pure sexuality", for Freud refused to acknowledge the sacred dimension of psychic energy, of libido. (20)</p>

<p>Existentialists are generally hostile toward 'positivism,' and while I would not want to defend Freud or positivism at every point, I do think that the hallmark of positivism -sense experience - will eventually erode much of the foundation upon which the theological fort of Altizer and the death of God theologians has been constructed. It is ironic that much of the stimulus behind the 'death of God' theology has come from modern science - whether it be the demythologizing of the 'three-decker universe' or our psychological interpretation of dreams and myths - and that theologians such as Altizer seem somewhat hostile toward the worldly methods of modern science. We may never again understand the Bible in the exact sense which our forefathers did; our understanding may have to mature, and psychological studies by men such as Eliade and Altizer may help this maturation. But if I understand Altizer 
correctly, he believes that the basic stimulus behind the Biblical religion was 
internal - within man's psyche; man was reaching out for God. </p>

<p>I suggest that the basic stimulus behind the Biblical religion was external - 
in the particular embodiment of a group of beings from another world who 
deliberately brought about the Biblical religion; through these beings God was 
reaching for man. I agree that much of the Biblical material can be explained in 
psychological terms. But I think that the 'honest to God' and 'death of God' 
theologies have made one basic mistake: they have demythologized and 
psychologized angels, the messengers from another world, and all they imply.</p>

<p>To return to the 'primitive camp' into which an airplane pilot has just parachuted, Bishop Robinson and Thomas Altizer are convinced that no stranger carrying a parachute will ever wander into our camp. They assume that a demythologized Christian faith must now be accepted as fact. To fly in the face of this fact amounts to intellectual dishonesty. In a newspaper report, Ian McLennan, 'director of the proposed Strasenburgh Planetarium of the Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences,' in his review of Frank Edwards's Flying Saucers - Serious Business, admitted that 'something has been happening in the sky - hundreds of thousands of people cannot make independent observations of the same optical phenomenon over thousands of square miles under a fantastic dose of mass hysteria.' (21) But McLennan cannot feel certain about what is being seen. </p>

<p>I believe that this is representative of the feeling of the scientific community at the present time - they admit that something is being seen, but scientists try to be careful not to mythologize the visible. Norton T. Novitt has suggested that a large body of flying ants might glow by attracting an electrical charge. (22) Together with stars, swamp gas, and clouds, there are any number of possible UFO explanations. But McLennan thinks it quite 'probable' that there is life on other planets in the universe. Thus it is possible within the framework of modem science to suggest that beings from another world could have been part of the Biblical environment, although most scientists would undoubtedly consider it unlikely. But it is possible. Bishop Robinson finds amusement at the thought that the Bible seems to picture 'a God "out there" coming to earth like some visitor from outer space.' (23) Precisely. </p>

<p>A haunting thought, is it not? How would primitive people react if they made contact with visitors from another world? The Bible suggests the Jesus came from another world, and that he returned to that world in a 'cloud.' It may be worth our time to look more closely at these Biblical 'clouds.'</p>
