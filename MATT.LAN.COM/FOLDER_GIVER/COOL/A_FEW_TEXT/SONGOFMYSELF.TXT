Stanzas 6 And 7



  6
  A child said
  What is the grass?
  fetching it to me with full hands;
  How could I
  answer the child? I do not know what it is
  any more than
  he.
  I guess it
  must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green
  stuff woven.
  Or I guess it
  is the handkerchief of the Lord,
  A scented gift
  and remembrancer designedly dropt,
  Bearing the
  owner's name someway in the corners, that we may
  see and
  remark, and say Whose?
  Or I guess the
  grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the
  vegetation.
  Or I guess it
  is a uniform hieroglyphic,
  And it means,
  Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,
  Growing among
  black folks as among white,
  Kanuck,
  Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I
  receive them
  the same.
  And now it
  seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.
  Tenderly will
  I use you curling grass,
  It may be you
  transpire from the breasts of young men,
  It may be if I
  had known them I would have loved them,
  It may be you
  are from old people, or from offspring taken soon
  out of their
  mothers' laps,
  And here you
  are the mothers' laps.
  This grass is
  very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,
  Darker than
  the colorless beards of old men,
  Dark to come
  from under the faint red roofs of mouths.
  O I perceive
  after all so many uttering tongues,
  And I perceive
  they do not come from the roofs of mouths for
  nothing.
  I wish I could
  translate the hints about the dead young men and
  women,
  And the hints
  about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken
  soon out of
  their laps.
  What do you
  think has become of the young and old men?
  And what do
  you think has become of the women and children?
  They are alive
  and well somewhere,
  The smallest
  sprout shows there is really no death,
  And if ever
  there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the
  end to arrest
  it,
  And ceas'd the
  moment life appear'd.
  All goes
  onward and outward, nothing collapses,
  And to die is
  different from what any one supposed, and luckier.
  7
  Has any one
  supposed it lucky to be born?
  I hasten to
  inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I
  know it.
  I pass death
  with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd babe,
  and am not
  contain'd between my hat and boots,
  And peruse
  manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,
  The earth good
  and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.
  I am not an
  earth nor an adjunct of an earth,
  I am the mate
  and companion of people, all just as immortal and
  fathomless as
  myself,
  (They do not
  know how immortal, but I know.)
  Every kind for
  itself and its own, for me mine male and female,
  For me those
  that have been boys and that love women,
  For me the man
  that is proud and feels how it stings to be
  slighted,
  For me the
  sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the
  mothers of
  mothers,
  For me lips
  that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,
  For me
  children and the begetters of children.
  Undrape! you
  are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,
  I see through
  the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
  And am around,
  tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be
  shaken away.
