In AD 590, a little over two centuries after Evagrius wrote his list, Pope Gregory I revised this list to form the more common Seven Deadly Sins, by folding (sorrow/despair/despondency) into acedia, vainglory into pride, and adding envy.[10] In the order used by Pope Gregory, and repeated by Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) centuries later in his epic poem The Divine Comedy, the seven deadly sins are as follows:


Inferno, Canto I
In the epic poem 
The Divine Comedy,
14th-century Italian poet Dante Alighieri leads the reader on an allegorical
journey through hell, purgatory, and paradise. In the opening of the poem, Dante
finds himself lost in a dark wood, which symbolizes his deviation from righteous
living. While attempting to get his bearings, Dante spots a shining hill, which
he calls the Mount of Joy. He begins to climb, but beasts, such as the she-wolf
of unrestraint and the lion of ambition, block his way. Disheartened, Dante
meets his guide Virgil, the 1st-century-BC Roman
poet, who explains that to regain his way, Dante must travel with Virgil through
hell and purgatory, and, with another guide, visit paradise.

The
Divine Comedy: Inferno,
Canto I
By
Dante Alighieri


  Midway in our
  life's journey, I went astray
  from the
  straight road and woke to find myself
  alone in a
  dark wood. How shall I say
  what wood that
  was! I never saw so drear,
  so rank, so
  arduous a wilderness!
  Its very
  memory gives a shape to fear.
  Death could
  scarce be more bitter than that place!
  But since it
  came to good, I will recount
  all that I
  found revealed there by God's grace.
  How I came to
  it I cannot rightly say,
  so drugged and
  loose with sleep had I become
  when I first
  wandered there from the True Way.
  But at the far
  end of that valley of evil
  whose maze had
  sapped my very heart with fear
  I found myself
  before a little hill
  and lifted up
  my eyes. Its shoulders glowed
  already with
  the sweet rays of that planet
  whose virtue
  leads men straight on every road,
  and the
  shining strengthened me against the fright
  whose agony
  had wracked the lake of my heart
  through all
  the terrors of that piteous night.
  Just as a
  swimmer, who with his last breath
  flounders
  ashore from perilous seas, might turn
  to memorize
  the wide water of his death—
  so did I turn,
  my soul still fugitive
  from death's
  surviving image, to stare down
  that pass that
  none had ever left alive.
  And there I
  lay to rest from my heart's race
  till calm and
  breath returned to me. Then rose
  and pushed up
  that dead slope at such a pace
  each footfall
  rose above the last. And lo!
  almost at the
  beginning of the rise
  I faced a
  spotted Leopard, all tremor and flow
  and gaudy
  pelt. And it would not pass, but stood
  so blocking my
  every turn that time and again
  I was on the
  verge of turning back to the wood.
  This fell at
  the first widening of the dawn
  as the sun was
  climbing Aries with those stars
  that rode with
  him to light the new creation.
  Thus the holy
  hour and the sweet season
  of
  commemoration did much to arm my fear
  of that bright
  murderous beast with their good omen.
  Yet not so
  much but what I shook with dread
  at sight of a
  great Lion that broke upon me
  raging with
  hunger, its enormous head
  held high as
  if to strike a mortal terror
  into the very
  air. And down his track,
  a She-Wolf
  drove upon me, a starved horror
  ravening and
  wasted beyond all belief.
  She seemed a
  rack for avarice, gaunt and craving.
  Oh many the
  souls she has brought to endless grief!
  She brought
  such heaviness upon my spirit
  at sight of
  her savagery and desperation,
  I died from
  every hope of that high summit.
  And like a
  miser—eager in acquisition
  but desperate
  in self-reproach when Fortune's wheel
  turns to the
  hour of his loss—all tears and attrition
  I wavered
  back; and still the beast pursued,
  forcing
  herself against me bit by bit
  till I slid
  back into the sunless wood.
  And as I fell
  to my soul's ruin, a presence
  gathered
  before me on the discolored air,
  the figure of
  one who seemed hoarse from long silence.
  At sight of
  him in that friendless waste I cried:
  'Have
  pity on me, whatever thing you are,
  whether shade
  or living man.' And it replied:
  'Not man,
  though man I once was, and my blood
  was Lombard,
  both my parents Mantuan.
  I was born,
  though late, sub
  Julio, and bred
  in Rome under
  Augustus in the noon
  of the false
  and lying gods. I was a poet
  and sang of
  old Anchises' noble son
  who came to
  Rome after the burning of Troy.
  But you—why
  do you
  return to these distresses
  instead of
  climbing that shining Mount of Joy
  which is the
  seat and first cause of man's bliss?'
  'And are
  you then that Virgil and that fountain
  of purest
  speech?' My voice grew tremulous:
  'Glory
  and light of poets! now may that zeal
  and love's
  apprenticeship that I poured out
  on your heroic
  verses serve me well!
  For you are my
  true master and first author,
  the sole maker
  from whom I drew the breath
  of that sweet
  style whose measures have brought me honor.
  See there,
  immortal sage, the beast I flee.
  For my soul's
  salvation, I beg you, guard me from her,
  for she has
  struck a mortal tremor through me.'
  And he
  replied, seeing my soul in tears:
  'He must
  go by another way who would escape
  this
  wilderness, for that mad beast that fleers
  before you
  there, suffers no man to pass.
  She tracks
  down all, kills all, and knows no glut,
  but, feeding,
  she grows hungrier than she was.
  She mates with
  any beast, and will mate with more
  before the
  Greyhound comes to hunt her down.
  He will not
  feed on lands nor loot, but honor
  and love and
  wisdom will make straight his way.
  He will rise
  between Feltro and Feltro, and in him
  shall be the
  resurrection and new day
  of that sad
  Italy for which Nisus died,
  and Turnus,
  and Euryalus, and the maid Camilla.
  He shall hunt
  her through every nation of sick pride
  till she is
  driven back forever to Hell
  whence Envy
  first released her on the world.
  Therefore, for
  your own good, I think it well
  you follow me
  and I will be your guide
  and lead you
  forth through an eternal place.
  There you
  shall see the ancient spirits tried
  in endless
  pain, and hear their lamentation
  as each
  bemoans the second death of souls.
  Next you shall
  see upon a burning mountain
  souls in fire
  and yet content in fire,
  knowing that
  whensoever it may be
  they yet will
  mount into the blessed choir.
  To which, if
  it is still your wish to climb,
  A worthier
  spirit shall be sent to guide you.
  With her shall
  I leave you, for the King of Time,
  who reigns on
  high, forbids me to come there
  since, living,
  I rebelled against his law.
  He rules the
  waters and the land and air
  and there
  holds court, his city and his throne.
  Oh blessed are
  they he chooses!' And I to him:
  'Poet, by
  that God to you unknown,
  lead me this
  way. Beyond this present ill
  and worse to
  dread, lead me to Peter's gate
  and be my
  guide through the sad halls of Hell.'
  And he then:
  'Follow.' And he moved ahead
  in silence,
  and I followed where he led.
