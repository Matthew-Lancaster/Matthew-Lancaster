<b>Thucydides: From History of the Peloponnesian War</b><br>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif" color="#4a7173" size="2">Following
is an excerpt from the famous funeral oration given in 431 BC by the Athenian
statesman Pericles, who presided over Athens in its golden age. In his speech,
Pericles honored the Athenians who had been first to die in the Peloponnesian
War, a destructive war begun that same year between confederacies headed by
Athens and by Sparta. Pericles praised Athens, listing ways in which he felt
Athenians surpassed Spartans. Pericles’ contemporary, the Greek historian
Thucydides, recorded the funeral oration in his</font><i> <font face="MS Reference Sans Serif" color="#4a7173" size="2">History

<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif" color="#323232" size="1">By
Thucydides</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Serif" color="#323232">‘I have no
wish to make a long speech on subjects familiar to you all: so I shall say
nothing about the warlike deeds by which we acquired our power or the battles in
which we or our fathers gallantly resisted our enemies, Greek or foreign. What I
want to do is, in the first place, to discuss the spirit in which we faced our
trials and also our constitution and the way of life which has made us great.
After that I shall speak in praise of the dead, believing that this kind of
speech is not inappropriate to the present occasion, and that this whole
assembly, of citizens and foreigners, may listen to it with advantage.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Serif" color="#323232">‘Let me say
that our system of government does not copy the institutions of our neighbours.
It is more the case of our being a model to others, than of our imitating anyone
else. Our constitution is called a democracy because power is in the hands not
of a minority but of the whole people. When it is a question of settling private
disputes, everyone is equal before the law; when it is a question of putting one
person before another in positions of public responsibility, what counts is not
membership of a particular class, but the actual ability which the man
possesses. No one, so long as he has it in him to be of service to the state, is
kept in political obscurity because of poverty. And, just as our political life
is free and open, so is our day-to-day life in our relations with each other. We
do not get into a state with our next-door neighbour if he enjoys himself in his
own way, nor do we give him the kind of black looks which, though they do no
real harm, still do hurt people's feelings. We are free and tolerant in our
private lives; but in public affairs we keep to the law. This is because it
commands our deep respect.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Serif" color="#323232">‘We give our
obedience to those whom we put in positions of authority, and we obey the laws
themselves, especially those which are for the protection of the oppressed, and
those unwritten laws which it is an acknowledged shame to break.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Serif" color="#323232">‘And here is
another point. When our work is over, we are in a position to enjoy all kinds of
recreation for our spirits. There are various kinds of contests and sacrifices
regularly throughout the year; in our own homes we find a beauty and a good
taste which delight us every day and which drive away our cares. Then the
greatness of our city brings it about that all the good things from all over the
world flow in to us, so that to us it seems just as natural to enjoy foreign
goods as our own local products.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Serif" color="#323232">‘Then there is
a great difference between us and our opponents, in our attitude towards
military security. Here are some examples: Our city is open to the world, and we
have no periodical deportations in order to prevent people observing or finding
out secrets which might be of military advantage to the enemy. This is because
we rely, not on secret weapons, but on our own real courage and loyalty. There
is a difference, too, in our educational systems. The Spartans, from their
earliest boyhood, are submitted to the most laborious training in courage; we
pass our lives without all these restrictions, and yet are just as ready to face
the same dangers as they are. Here is a proof of this: When the Spartans invade
our land, they do not come by themselves, but bring all their allies with them;
whereas we, when we launch an attack abroad, do the job by ourselves, and,
though fighting on foreign soil, do not often fail to defeat opponents who are
fighting for their own hearths and homes. As a matter of fact none of our
enemies has ever yet been confronted with our total strength, because we have to
divide our attention between our navy and the many missions on which our troops
are sent on land. Yet, if our enemies engage a detachment of our forces and
defeat it, they give themselves credit for having thrown back our entire army;
or, if they lose, they claim that they were beaten by us in full strength. There
are certain advantages, I think, in our way of meeting danger voluntarily, with
an easy mind, instead of with a laborious training, with natural rather than
with state-induced courage. We do not have to spend our time practising to meet
sufferings which are still in the future; and when they are actually upon us we
show ourselves just as brave as these others who are always in strict training.
This is one point in which, I think, our city deserves to be admired. There are
also others:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Serif" color="#323232">‘Our love of
what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the
mind does not make us soft. We regard wealth as something to be properly used,
rather than as something to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed
to admit it: the real shame is in not taking practical measures to escape from
it. Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs but in the
affairs of the state as well: even those who are mostly occupied with their own
business are extremely well-informed on general politics—this is a peculiarity
of ours: we do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who
minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all. We
Athenians, in our own persons, take our decisions on policy or submit them to
proper discussions: for we do not think that there is an incompatibility between
words and deeds; the worst thing is to rush into action before the consequences
have been properly debated. And this is another point where we differ from other
people. We are capable at the same time of taking risks and of estimating them
beforehand. Others are brave out of ignorance; and, when they stop to think,
they begin to fear. But the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who
best knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and
then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Serif" color="#323232">‘Again, in
questions of general good feeling there is a great contrast between us and most
other people. We make friends by doing good to others, not by receiving good
from them. This makes our friendship all the more reliable, since we want to
keep alive the gratitude of those who are in our debt by showing continued
goodwill to them: whereas the feelings of one who owes us something lack the
same enthusiasm, since he knows that, when he repays our kindness, it will be
more like paying back a debt than giving something spontaneously. We are unique
in this. When we do kindnesses to others, we do not do them out of any
calculations of profit or loss: we do them without afterthought, relying on our
free liberality. Taking everything together then, I declare that our city is an
education to Greece, and I declare that in my opinion each single one of our
citizens, in all the manifold aspects of life, is able to show himself the
rightful lord and owner of his own person, and do this, moreover, with
exceptional grace and exceptional versatility. And to show that this is no empty
boasting for the present occasion, but real tangible fact, you have only to
consider the power which our city possesses and which has been won by those very
qualities which I have mentioned. Athens, alone of the states we know, comes to
her testing time in a greatness that surpasses what was imagined of her. In her
case, and in her case alone, no invading enemy is ashamed at being defeated, and
no subject can complain of being governed by people unfit for their
responsibilities. Mighty indeed are the marks and monuments of our empire which
we have left. Future ages will wonder at us, as the present age wonders at us
now. We do not need the praises of a Homer, or of anyone else whose words may
delight us for the moment, but whose estimation of facts will fall short of what
is really true. For our adventurous spirit has forced an entry into every sea
and into every land; and everywhere we have left behind us everlasting memorials
of good done to our friends or suffering inflicted on our enemies.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="MS Reference Serif" color="#323232">‘This then, is
the kind of city for which these men, who could not bear the thought of losing
her, nobly fought and nobly died. It is only natural that every one of us who
survive them should be willing to undergo hardships in her service. And it was
for this reason that I have spoken at such length about our city, because I
wanted to make it clear that for us there is more at stake than there is for
others who lack our advantages; also I wanted my words of praise for the dead to
be set in the bright light of evidence. And now the most important of these
words has been spoken. I have sung the praises of our city; but it was the
courage and gallantry of these men, and of people like them, which made her
splendid. Nor would you find it true in the case of many of the Greeks, as it is
true of them, that no words can do more than justice to their deeds.</font></p>
