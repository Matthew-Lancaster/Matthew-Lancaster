If we do not maintain Justice, Justice will not maintain us.


Francis Bacon 
1561 --1626
English philosopher, essayist, statesman

Speech for prosecution, as Attorney General, in Overbury murder case, Nov. 1615.


-------
Justice
-------

If one really wishes to know how justice is administered in a country, one does not question the policemen, the lawyers, the judges, or the protected members of the middle class. One goes to the unprotected --those, precisely, who need the laws's protection most! --and listens to their testimony.


James Baldwin 
1924 --1987
U.S. author

The Price of the Ticket,  "No Name in the Street"  (1972).


-------
Justice
-------

Justice in the hands of the powerful is merely a governing system like any other. Why call it justice?  Let us rather call it injustice, but of a sly effective order, based entirely on cruel knowledge of the resistance of the weak, their capacity for pain, humilation and misery. Injustice sustained at the exact degree of necessary tension to turn the cogs of the huge machine-for-the-making-of-rich-men, without bursting the boiler.


Georges Bernanos 
1888 --1948
French novelist, political writer

M. Olivier, in The Diary of a Country Priest, ch. 7 (1936).

-------
Justice
-------

A good parson once said that where mystery begins religion ends. Cannot I say, as truly at least, of human laws, that where mystery begins justice ends?


Edmund Burke 
1729 --97
Irish philosopher, statesman

A Vindication of Natural Society  (1756).


-------
Justice
-------

Absolute justice is achieved by the suppression of all contradiction: therefore it destroys freedom.


Albert Camus 
1913 --60
French-Algerian philosopher, author

The Rebel, pt. 5,  "Historic Murder"  (1951; tr. 1953).


-------
Justice
-------

Justice begins with the recognition of the necessity of sharing. The oldest law is that which regulates it, and this is still the most important law today and, as such, has remained the basic concern of all movements which have at heart the community of human activities and of human existence in general.


Elias Canetti 
b. 1905
Austrian novelist, philosopher

Crowds and Power,  "Distiribution and Increase"  (1960; tr. 1962).

-------
Justice
-------

If some beggar steals a bridle
he'll be hung by a man who's stolen a horse.
There's no surer justice in the world than that
which makes the rich thief hang the poor one.

c. 1180 --1272), French troubadour poet.  "Las amairitz, qui encolpar las vol," published in Songs of the Troubadours  (ed. and tr. by Anthony Bonner, 1972).

-------
Justice

Justice is a whore that won't let herself be stiffed, and collects the wages of shame even from the poor.


Karl Kraus 
1874 --1936
Austrian satirist

 "The Good Conduct Medal"  (1909; repr. in In These Great Times: A Karl Kraus Reader, ed. by Harry Zohn, 1976).

The love of justice is, in most men, nothing more than the fear of suffering injustice.


François, Duc De La Rochefoucauld

-------
Justice

----------------------------
--------- Kindness ---------
----------------------------

When kindness has left people, even for a few moments, we become afraid of them as if their reason had left them. When it has left a place where we have always found it, it is like shipwreck; we drop from security into something malevolent and bottomless.


Willa Cather 
1876 --1947
U.S. author

My Mortal Enemy  (1926; repr. 1963, p. 62).


--------
Kindness
--------

A man without nobility cannot have kindliness; he can only have good nature.


Sebastien-Roch Nicolas De Chamfort 
1741 --94
French writer, wit

Maxims and Considerations, vol. 1, no. 116 (1796; tr. 1926).


--------
Kindness
--------

Kindliness seems to exist primarily as an animal instinct, so deeply rooted that mental degeneracy, which works from the top down, does not destroy it until the mind sinks to the lower grades of idiocy.


Charles Horton Cooley 
1864 --1929
U.S. sociologist

Human Nature and the Social Order, ch. 4 (1902).


--------
Kindness
--------

Ignorant kindness may have the effect of cruelty; but to be angry with it as if it were direct cruelty would be an ignorant unkindness.


George Eliot 
1819 --80
English novelist, editor

Daniel Deronda, bk. 8, ch. 59 (1876).


--------
Kindness
--------

True kindness presupposes the faculty of imagining as one's own the suffering and joys of others.


Andre Gide 
1869 --1951
French author

Pretexts,  "Portraits and Aphorisms"  (1903).


--------
Kindness
--------

It is futile to judge a kind deed by its motives. Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind.


Eric Hoffer 
1902 --83
U.S. philosopher

The Passionate State of Mind, aph. 123 (1955).


--------
Kindness
--------

Human kindness is like a defective tap, the first gush may be impressive but the stream soon dries up.


P. D. James 
b. 1920
British mystery writer

Jonah the tramp, in Devices and Desires, ch. 40 (1989).

--------

One could laugh at the world better if it didn't mix tender kindliness with its brutality.


D. H. Lawrence 
1885 --1930
British author

Letter, 3 Oct. 1910 (published in The Letters of D. H. Lawrence, vol. 1, ed. by James T. Boulton, 1979).


--------
Kindness
--------

It is a terrible thing, this kindness that human beings do not lose. Terrible because when we are finally naked in the dark and cold, it is all we have. We who are so rich, so full of strength, wind up with that small change. We have nothing else to give.


Ursula K. Le Guin 
b. 1929
U.S. author

The Left Hand of Darkness, ch. 13 (1969).

Kindness
--------

When you are young you take the kindness people show you as your right.


W. Somerset Maugham 
1874 --1965
British author

Cakes and Ale, ch. 12 (1930).


--------
Kindness
--------

Kindness is a virtue neither modern nor urban. One almost unlearns it in a city. Towns have their own beatitude; they are not unfriendly; they offer a vast and solacing anonymity or an equally vast and solacing gregariousness. But one needs a neighbor on whom to practice compassion.


Phyllis McGinley 
1905 --78
U.S. poet, author

The Province of the Heart,  "A Garland of Kindness"  (1959).


--------
Kindness
--------

If you stop to be kind, you must swerve often from your path.

---------------------------
--------- Kissing ---------
---------------------------

Kisses honeyed by oblivion.


George Eliot 
1819 --80
English novelist

The Spanish Gypsy, bk. 3 (1868).


-------
Kissing
-------

There used to be two kinds of kisses. First when girls were kissed and deserted; second, when they were engaged. Now there's a third kind, where the man is kissed and deserted. If Mr. Jones of the nineties bragged he'd kissed a girl, everyone knew he was through with her. If Mr. Jones of 1919 brags the same everyone knows it's because he can't kiss her any more. Given a decent start any girl can beat a man nowadays.


F. Scott Fitzgerald 
1896 --1940
U.S. author

Rosalind Connage, in This Side of Paradise, bk. 2, ch. 1 (1920).


-------
Kissing
-------

The kiss originated when the first male reptile licked the first female reptile, implying in a subtle, complimentary way that she was as succulent as the small reptile he had for dinner the night before.


F. Scott Fitzgerald 
1896 --1940
U.S. author

The Crack-Up,  "Notebook E"  (ed. by Edmund Wilson, 1945).


-------
Kissing
-------

But his kiss was so sweet, and so closely he pressed,
That I languished and pined till I granted the rest.


John Gay 
1685 --1732
English dramatist

Lucy, in The Beggar's Opera, act 3, sc. 1, Air 41.


-------
Kissing
-------

The kiss. There are all sorts of kisses, lad, from the sticky confection to the kiss of death. Of them all, the kiss of an actress is the most unnerving. How can we tell if she means it or if she's just practicing?


Ruth Gordon 
b. 1896
U.S. playwright, actor

Benjy, in The Leading Lady, act 2 (1948).


-------
Kissing
-------

Oh what lies lurk in kisses!


Heinrich Heine 
1797 --1856
German poet, journalist

In den Küssen welche Lüge, st. 1.


-------
Kissing
-------

The sound of a kiss is not so loud as that of a cannon, but its echo lasts a great deal longer.


Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.
 
1809 --94
U.S. writer, physician

The Professor at the Breakfast-Table, ch. 11 (1859).


-------
Kissing
-------

What did that mean, to kiss?  You put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?


James Joyce 
1882 --1941
Irish author

Stephen Dedalus, in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, ch. 1 (1916).


-------
Kissing

When women kiss it always reminds one of prize-fighters shaking hands.


H. L. Mencken 
1880 --1956
U.S. journalist

A Mencken Chrestomathy, ch. 30 (1949).


-------
Kissing
-------

A kiss is but a kiss now! and no wave
Of a great flood that whirls me to the sea.
But, as you will! we'll sit contentedly,
And eat our pot of honey on the grave.


George Meredith 
1828 --1909
English author

Modern Love, sonnet 29 (1862).


-------
Kissing
-------

A kiss can be a comma, a question mark or an exclamation point. That's basic spelling that every woman ought to know.


Mistinguett 
1874 --1956
French dancer, singer

Theatre Arts  (Dec. 1955).


-------
Kissing
-------

He took the bride about the neck
And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo.


William Shakespeare 
1564 --1616
English dramatist, poet

Gremio, in The Taming of the Shrew, act 3, sc. 3, of Petruccio and Katherine (Kate).


-------
Kissing
-------

The social kiss is an exchange of insincerity between two combatants on the field of social advancement. It places hygiene before affection and condescension before all else.


Sunday Correspondent, London 



 (12 Aug. 1990)

-------
Kissing
-------

Stephen's kiss was lost in jest,
Robin's lost in play,
But the kiss in Colin's eyes
Haunts me night and day.


Sara Teasdale 
1884 --1933
U.S. poet

The Look, st. 2.


-------
Kissing
-------

A kiss may ruin a human life.


Oscar Wilde 
1854 --1900
Anglo-Irish playwright, author

Mrs. Arbuthnot, in A Woman of No Importance, act 4.

-----------------------------
--------- Knowledge ---------
-----------------------------

The utmost extent of man's knowledge, is to know that he knows nothing.


Joseph Addison 
1672 --1719
English essayist

Interesting Anecdotes, Memoirs, Allegories, Essays, and Poetical Fragments,  "Essay on Pride"  (1794).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Can the knowledge deriving from reason even begin to compare with knowledge perceptible by sense?  No doubt the number of people crass enough to reply exclusively on the former and scorn the latter are sufficient in themselves to explain the disfavor into which everything deriving from the senses has gradually fallen. But when the most scholarly of men have taught me that light is a vibration, or offered me any other fruits of their labors of reasoning, they will not have rendered me an account of what is important to me about light, of what my eyes have begun to teach me about it, of what makes me different from a blind man --things which are the stuff of miracles, not subject matter for reasoning.


Louis Aragon 
1897 --1982
French poet

Paris Peasant,  "Preface to a Modern Mythology"  (first published 1926; repr. 1971).


---------
Knowledge
---------

All men by nature desire knowledge.


Aristotle

Knowledge
---------

Walter Benjamin 
1892 --1940
German critic, philosopher

Letter, 9 Dec. 1923 (published in Briefe, no. 126, Frankfurt, 1966). Quoted in: Susan Sontag,  "Under the Sign of Saturn," introductory essay to One-Way Street and Other Writings  (1978).


---------
Knowledge
---------

There can be no knowledge without emotion. We may be aware of a truth, yet until we have felt its force, it is not ours. To the cognition of the brain must be added the experience of the soul.


Arnold Bennett 
1867 --1931
British novelist

The Journals of Arnold Bennett  (1932), entry for 18 March 1897.


---------
Knowledge
---------

For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.


Bible, Hebrew.
 



Ecclesiastes 1:18.


---------
Knowledge
---------

There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: the way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.


Bible, Hebrew.
 



Agur, son of Jakeh, in Proverbs 30:18 --19.


---------
Knowledge
---------

Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.


Bible: New Testament.
 



1 Corinthians 8:1 --2.


---------
Knowledge
---------

The real community of man. . . is the community of those who seek the truth, of the potential knowers.


Allan Bloom 
1930 --92
U.S. educator, author

The Closing of the American Mind, pt. 3,  "The Student and the University"  (1987).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Sorrow is knowledge: they who know the most
Must mourn the deepest o'er the fatal truth,
The Tree of Knowledge is not that of life.


Lord Byron 
1788 --1824
English poet

Manfred's opening speech in Manfred, act 1, sc. 1. As Michael Foot recorded in his biography, The Politics of Paradise: A Vindication of Byron, ch. 5 (1988), this speech was considered by Nietzsche to be "immortal" for stating the terrible fact that a man might bleed to death through the truth that he recognizes.


---------
Knowledge
---------

There's a theory, one I find persuasive, that the quest for knowledge is, at bottom, the search for the answer to the question:  "Where was I before I was born."  In the beginning was. . . what?  Perhaps, in the beginning, there was a curious room, a room like this one, crammed with wonders; and now the room and all it contains are forbidden you, although it was made just for you, had been prepared for you since time began, and you will spend all your life trying to remember it.


Angela Carter 
1940 --92
British author

The Curious Room, uncollected short story read at Basel University conference. Quoted in: New Writing  (ed. by Malcolm Bradbury and Judy Cooke, 1992).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,
The mere materials with which wisdom builds,
Till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place,
Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich.
Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much;
Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.


William Cowper 
1731 --1800
English poet

The Task, bk. 6 (1785).


---------
Knowledge
---------

To know all is not to forgive all. It is to despise everybody.


Quentin Crisp 
b. 1908
British author

The Naked Civil Servant, ch. 11 (1968).


---------
Knowledge
---------

You have to believe in God before you can say there are things that man was not meant to know. I don't think there's anything man wasn't meant to know. There are just some stupid things that people shouldn't do.


David Cronenberg 
b. 1943
Canadian filmmaker

Cronenberg on Cronenberg, ch. 1 (ed. by Chris Rodley, 1992).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Knowledge is not a passion from without the mind, but an active exertion of the inward strength, vigour and power of the mind, displaying itself from within.


Ralph J. Cudworth 
1617 --88
English theologian, philosopher

Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality, bk. 4, ch. 1, sct. 1 (1731).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Knowledge is a polite word for dead but not buried imagination.


E. E. Cummings 
1894 --1962
U.S. poet

Jottings, in Wake, no. 10 (1951; repr. in A Miscellany, ed. by George J. Firmage, 1958).


---------
Knowledge
---------

There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge available to us: observation of nature, reflection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts; reflection combines them; experimentation verifies the result of that combination. Our observation of nature must be diligent, our reflection profound, and our experiments exact. We rarely see these three means combined; and for this reason, creative geniuses are not common.


Denis Diderot 
1713 --84
French philosopher

On the Interpretation of Nature, no. 15 (1753; repr. in Selected Writings, ed. by Lester G. Crocker, 1966).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.


Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
1859 --1930
English author

Sherlock Holmes, in A Study in Scarlet, ch. 2 (1887).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Of a truth, Knowledge is power, but it is a power reined by scruple, having a conscience of what must be and what may be; whereas Ignorance is a blind giant who, let him but wax unbound, would make it a sport to seize the pillars that hold up the long-wrought fabric of human good, and turn all the places of joy as dark as a buried Babylon.


George Eliot 
1819 --80
English novelist, editor

Daniel Deronda, bk. 3, ch. 21 (1876).


---------
Knowledge
---------

For lust of knowing what should not be known,
We take the Golden Road to Samarkand.


James Elroy Flecker 
1884 --1915
British poet

Ishak, in Hassan, act 5, sc. 2 (1922).


---------
Knowledge
---------

It seems to me that man is made to act rather than to know: the principles of things escape our most persevering researches.


Frederick The Great 
1712 --86
King of Prussia

Letter, 30 Sept. 1783, to mathematician and philosopher Jean le Rond d'Alembert.


---------
Knowledge
---------

A little knowledge that acts is worth infinitely more than much knowledge that is idle.

1883 --1931
Lebanese poet, novelist

The Voice of the Master, pt. 2, ch. 8 (1960; repr. in A Second Treasury of Kahlil Gibran, tr. by Anthony Ferris, 1962).


---------
Knowledge
---------

A man can only attain knowledge with the help of those who possess it. This must be understood from the very beginning. One must learn from him who knows.

George Gurdjieff 
c. 1877 --1949
Greek-Armenian religious teacher, mystic

Quoted in: P. D. Ouspensky, In Search of the Miraculous, ch. 2 (1949).

---------

All knowledge is ambiguous.


J. S. Habgood 
b. 1927
British ecclesiastic, Archbishop of York

Observer  (London, 14 April 1991).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Man is distinguished, not only by his reason; but also by this singular passion from other animals. . . which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continual and indefatigable generation of knowledge, exceeds the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure.


Thomas Hobbes 
1588 --1679
English philosopher

Leviathan, pt. 1, ch. 6 (1651).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Knowledge about life is one thing; effective occupation of a place in life, with its dynamic currents passing through your being, is another.


William James 
1842 --1910
U.S. psychologist, philosopher

The Varieties of Religious Experience, lecture 20 (1902).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Man is not weak; knowledge is more than equivalent to force.


Samuel Johnson 
1709 --84
English author, lexicographer

Imlac, in The History of Rasselas, ch. 13 (1759).


---------
Knowledge
---------

Knowledge is happiness, because to have knowledge --broad, deep knowledge --is to know true ends from false, and lofty things from low. To know the thoughts and deeds that have marked man's progress is to feel the great heart-throbs of humanity through the centuries; and if one does not feel in these pulsations a heavenward striving, one must indeed be deaf to the harmonies of life.


Helen Keller 
1880 --1968
U.S. blind/deaf author, lecturer

The Story of My Life, pt. 1, ch. 20 (1903).


---------
Knowledge
---------

To know yet to think that one does not know is
  best;
Not to know yet to think that one knows will lead
  to difficulty.

Knowledge is what we get when an observer, preferably a scientifically trained observer, provides us with a copy of reality that we can all recognize.

Knowledge

Knowledge is and will be produced in order to be sold, it is and will be consumed in order to be valorized in a new production: in both cases, the goal is exchange. Knowledge ceases to be an end in itself, it loses its use-value.

If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating it yourself. . . . If you want to know the theory and methods of revolution, you must take part in revolution. All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience.

Knowledge

The use of knowledge in our sex (beside the amusement of solitude) is to moderate the passions and learn to be contented with a small expense, which are the certain effects of a studious life and, it may be, preferable even to that fame which men have engrossed to themselves and will not suffer us to share.


Lady Mary Wortley Montagu 
1689 --1762

Letter, 28 Jan. 1753, to her daughter Lady Bute (published in Selected Letters, ed. by Robert Halsband, 1970).

 "The tree of knowledge is not the tree of life!"  And yet can we cast out of our spirits all the good or evil poured into them by so many learned generations?  Ignorance cannot be learned.


Gerard De Nerval

French novelist and poet

Aurélia, pt. 2, ch. 1 (1855; repr. in Selected Writings, ed. and tr. by Geoffrey Wagner, 1958).


---------
Knowledge
---------

We have no organ at all for knowledge, for "truth": we "know"  (or believe or imagine) precisely as much as may be useful in the interest of the human herd, the species: and even what is here called "usefulness" is in the end only a belief, something imagined and perhaps precisely that most fatal piece of stupidity by which we shall one day perish.

As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself.


Arthur Schopenhauer 
1788 --1860
German philosopher

Parerga and Paralipomena, vol. 2, ch. 22, sct. 257 (1851).


---------
Knowledge
---------

We are in fact convinced that if we are ever to have pure knowledge of anything, we must get rid of the body and contemplate things by themselves with the soul by itself. It seems, to judge from the argument, that the wisdom which we desire and upon which we profess to have set our hearts will be attainable only when we are dead and not in our lifetime.


Socrates

Greek philosopher

Quoted in: Plato, Phaedo, sct. 65.


---------
Knowledge
---------

The knowledge of an unlearned man is living and luxuriant like a forest, but covered with mosses and lichens and for the most part inaccessible and going to waste; the knowledge of the man of science is like timber collected in yards for public works, which still supports a green sprout here and there, but even this is liable to dry rot.

When you see the abyss, and we have looked into it, then what? There isn't much room at the edge --one person, another, not many. If you are there, others cannot be there. If you are there, you become a protective wall. What happens?  You become part of the abyss.

Girls who put out are tramps. Girls who don't are ladies. This is, however, a rather archaic usage of the word. Should one of you boys happen upon a girl who doesn't put out, do not jump to the conclusion that you have found a lady. What you have probably found is a lesbian.

A lady is nothing very specific. One man's lady is another man's woman; sometimes, one man's lady is another man's wife. Definitions overlap but they almost never coincide.

Give us that grand word "woman" once again,

All official institutions of language are repeating machines: school, sports, advertising, popular songs, news, all continually repeat the same structure, the same meaning, often the same words: the stereotype is a political fact, the major figure of ideology.

I ascribe a basic importance to the phenomenon of language. . . . To speak means to be in a position to use a certain syntax, to grasp the morphology of this or that language, but it means above all to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization.

Any language is necessarily a finite system applied with different degrees of creativity to an infinite variety of situations, and most of the words and phrases we use are "prefabricated" in the sense that we don't coin new ones every time we speak.

Language, the machine of the poet, is best fitted for his purpose in its rudest state. Nations, like individuals, first perceive, and then abstract. They advance from particular images to general terms. Hence the vocabulary of an enlightened society is philosophical, that of a half-civilised people is poetical.

The significance of language for the evolution of culture lies in this, that mankind set up in language a separate world beside the other world, a place it took to be so firmly set that, standing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it. To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal: he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world.

Man, even man debased by the neocapitalism and pseudosocialism of our time, is a marvelous being because he sometimes speaks.

You can't write about people out of textbooks, and you can't use jargon. You have to speak clearly and simply and purely in a language that a six-year-old child can understand; and yet have the meanings and the overtones of language, and the implications, that appeal to the highest intelligence.

Language furnishes the best proof that a law accepted by a community is a thing that is tolerated and not a rule to which all freely consent.


Ferdinand De Saussure 
1857 --1913
Swiss linguist

Course in General Linguistics, pt. 1, ch. 2, sct. 1 (1916).  "Of all social institutions," de Saussure continued,  "language is least amenable to initiative. It blends with the life of society, and the latter, inert by nature, is a prime conservative force."

Language is the amber in which a thousand precious and subtle thoughts have been safely embedded and preserved. It has arrested ten thousand lightning flashes of genius, which, unless thus fixed and arrested, might have been as bright, but would have also been as quickly passing and perishing, as the lightning.

As societies grow decadent, the language grows decadent, too. Words are used to disguise, not to illuminate, action: you liberate a city by destroying it. Words are to confuse, so that at election time people will solemnly vote against their own interests.

The living language is like a cowpath: it is the creation of the cows themselves, who, having created it, follow it or depart from it according to their whims or their needs. From daily use, the path undergoes change. A cow is under no obligation to stay in the narrow path she helped make, following the contour of the land, but she often profits by staying with it and she would be handicapped if she didn't know where it was or where it led to.

It is a mass language only in the same sense that its baseball slang is born of baseball players. That is, it is a language which is being molded by writers to do delicate things and yet be within the grasp of superficially educated people. It is not a natural growth, much as its proletarian writers would like to think so. But compared with it at its best, English has reached the Alexandrian stage of formalism and decay.

The problems of society will also be the problems of the predominant language of that society. It is the carrier of its perceptions, its attitudes, and its goals, for through it, the speakers absorb entrenched attitudes.

To write or even speak English is not a science but an art. There are no reliable words. . . . Whoever writes English is involved in a struggle that never lets up even for a sentence. He is struggling against vagueness, against obscurity, against the lure of the decorative adjective, against the encroachment of Latin and Greek, and, above all, against the worn-out phrases and dead metaphors with which the language is cluttered up.

Laughter on American television has taken the place of the chorus in Greek tragedy. . . . In other countries, the business of laughing is left to the viewers.

There is a kind of laughter that sickens the soul. Laughter when it is out of control: when it screams and stamps its feet, and sets the bells jangling in the next town. Laughter in all its ignorance and cruelty. Laughter with the seed of Satan in it. It tramples upon shrines; the belly-roarer. It roars, it yells, it is delirious: and yet it is as cold as ice.

Laughter

We are a nation that has always gone in for the loud laugh, the wow, the yak, the belly laugh, and the dozen other labels for the roll-'em-in-the-aisles gagerissimo. This is the kind of laugh that delights actors, directors, and producers, but dismays writers of comedy because it is the laugh that often dies in the lobby. The appreciative smile, the chuckle, the soundless mirth, so important to the success of comedy, cannot be understood unless one sits among the audience and feels the warmth created by the quality of laughter that the audience takes home with it.

Those laws, being forged for universal application, are in perpetual conflict with personal interest, just as personal interest is always in contradiction with the general interest. Good for society, our laws are very bad for the individuals whereof it is composed; for, if they one time protect the individual, they hinder, trouble, fetter him for three quarters of his life.

Amongst the learned the lawyers claim first place, the most self-satisfied class of people, as they roll their rock of Sisyphus and string together six hundred laws in the same breath, no matter whether relevant or not, piling up opinion on opinion and gloss on gloss to make their profession seem the most difficult of all.

My passions are all asleep from my having slumbered till nearly eleven and weakened the animal fibre all over me to a delightful sensation about three degrees on this sight of faintness --if I had teeth of pearl and the breath of lilies I should call it langour --but as I am I must call it laziness. In this state of effeminacy the fibres of the brain are relaxed in common with the rest of the body, and to such a happy degree that pleasure has no show of enticement and pain no unbearable frown. Neither poetry, nor ambition, nor love have any alertness of countenance as they pass by me.

Most of the ladies and gentlemen who mourn the passing of the nation's leaders wouldn't know a leader if they saw one.

Learning

I would by no means wish a daughter of mine to be a progeny of learning; I don't think so much learning becomes a young woman: for instance, I would never let her meddle with Greek, or Hebrew, or algebra, or simony, or fluxions, or paradoxes, or such inflammatory branches of learning; nor will it be necessary for her to handle any of your mathematical, astronomical, diabolical instruments; but. . . I would send her, at nine years old, to a boarding-school, in order to learn a little ingenuity and artifice: then, sir, she would have a supercilious knowledge in accounts, and, as she grew up, I would have her instructed in geometry, that she might know something of the contagious countries: this. . . is what I would have a woman know; and I don't think there is a superstitious article in it.

Love
----

We are not commanded (or forbidden) to love our mates, our children, our friends, our country because such affections come naturally to us and are good in themselves, although we may corrupt them.

It is unfortunately very true that, without leisure and money, love can be no more than an orgy of the common man. . . . Instead of being a sudden impulse full of ardour and reverie, it becomes a distastefully utilitarian affair.

 'Tis said of love that it sometimes goes, sometimes flies; runs with one, walks gravely with another; turns a third into ice, and sets a fourth in a flame: it wounds one, another it kills: like lightning it begins and ends in the same moment: it makes that fort yield at night which it besieged but in the morning; for there is no force able to resist it.

Love is the extra effort we make in our dealings with those whom we do not like and once you understand that, you understand all. This idea that love overtakes you is nonsense. This is but a polite manifestation of sex. To love another you have to undertake some fragment of their destiny.

Love
----

Romantic love, in pornography as in life, is the mythic celebration of female negation. For a woman, love is defined as her willingness to submit to her own annihilation. . . . The proof of love is that she is willing to be destroyed by the one whom she loves, for his sake. For the woman, love is always self-sacrifice, the sacrifice of identity, will, and bodily integrity, in order to fulfill and redeem the masculinity of her lover.

The idea that nations should love one another, or that business concerns or marketing boards should love one another, or that a man in Portugal should love a man in Peru of whom he has never heard --it is absurd, unreal, dangerous. . . .

Today I begin to understand what love must be, if it exists. . . . When we are parted, we each feel the lack of the other half of ourselves. We are incomplete like a book in two volumes of which the first has been lost. That is what I imagine love to be: incompleteness in absence.

Love, love, love --all the wretched cant of it, masking egotism, lust, masochism, fantasy under a mythology of sentimental postures, a welter of self-induced miseries and joys, blinding and masking the essential personalities in the frozen gestures of courtship, in the kissing and the dating and the desire, the compliments and the quarrels which vivify its barrenness.

----

One would always want to think of oneself as being on the side of love, ready to recognize it and wish it well --but, when confronted with it in others, one so often resented it, questioned its true nature, secretly dismissed the particular instance as folly or promiscuity. Was it merely jealousy, or a reluctance to admit so noble and enviable a sentiment in anyone but oneself?

Madame, it is an old word and each one takes it new and wears it out himself. It is a word that fills with meaning as a bladder with air and the meaning goes out of it as quickly. It may be punctured as a bladder is punctured and patched and blown up again and if you have not had it it does not exist for you. All people talk of it, but those who have had it are marked by it, and I would not wish to speak of it further since of all things it is the most ridiculous to talk of and only fools go through it many times.

Do you want me to tell you something really subversive?  Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. . . . It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more.

Nowadays men cannot love seven night but they must have all their desires: that love may not endure by reason; for where they be soon accorded and hasty, heat soon it cooleth. Right so fareth love nowadays, soon hot soon cold: this is no stability. But the old love was not so.

If love. . . means that one person absorbs the other, then no real relationship exists any more. Love evaporates; there is nothing left to love. The integrity of self is gone.

People who are not in love fail to understand how an intelligent man can suffer because of a very ordinary woman. This is like being surprised that anyone should be stricken with cholera because of a creature so insignificant as the comma bacillus.

----
Love
----

I regard as a mortal sin not only the lying of the senses in matters of love, but also the illusion which the senses seek to create where love is only partial. I say, I believe, that one must love with all of one's being, or else live, come what may, a life of complete chastity.


George Sand 
1804 --76

Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs,
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes,
Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers' tears.
What is it else?  A madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.

The Earth, in Prometheus Unbound, act 4.


----
Love
----

When desire, having rejected reason and overpowered judgment which leads to right, is set in the direction of the pleasure which beauty can inspire, and when again under the influence of its kindred desires it is moved with violent motion towards the beauty of corporeal forms, it acquires a surname from this very violent motion, and is called love.


Socrates 
469 --399 B.C.

True love makes the thought of death frequent, easy, without terrors; it merely becomes the standard of comparison, the price one would pay for many things.

We often speak of love when we really should be speaking of the drive to dominate or to master, so as to confirm ourselves as active agents, in control of our own destinies and worthy of respect from others.

A Gift for God,  "Riches"  (1975).


----
Love
----

Love feels no burden, regards not labors, strives toward more than it attains, argues not of impossibility, since it believes that it may and can do all things. Therefore it avails for all things, and fulfils and accomplishes much where one not a lover falls and lies helpless.


Thomas À Kempis

The Imitation of Christ, pt. 3, ch. 6 (1471).


----
Love
----

Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and eternal source.

Love
----

What is the main thing in love? to know and to hide. To know about the one you love and to hide that you love. At times the hiding (shame) overpowers the knowing (passion). The passion for the hidden --the passion for the revealed.

----
Love
----

For it is the suffering flesh, it is suffering, it is death, that lovers perpetuate upon the earth. Love is at once the brother, son, and father of death, which is its sister, mother, and daughter. And thus it is that in the depth of love there is a depth of eternal despair, out of which springs hope and consolation.

1864 --1936

It has ever been since time began,

U.S. dramatist

However it is debased or misinterpreted, love is a redemptive feature. To focus on one individual so that their desires become superior to yours is a very cleansing experience.


Jeanette Winterson

----
Love
----

For love. . . has two faces; one white, the other black; two bodies; one smooth, the other hairy. It has two hands, two feet, two tails, two, indeed, of every member and each one is the exact opposite of the other. Yet, so strictly are they joined together that you cannot separate them.


Virginia Woolf

A man falls in love through his eyes, a woman through her ears.


Woodrow Wyatt 
b. 1918

The Pity of Love

-------------------------------

A bizarre sensation pervades a relationship of pretense. No truth seems true. A simple morning's greeting and response appear loaded with innuendo and fraught with implications. . . . Each nicety becomes more sterile and each withdrawal more permanent.

I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together again and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new. What is broken is broken --and I'd rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived.

---------------------------------------
--------- Love at First Sight ---------
---------------------------------------

I do not think that what is called Love at first sight is so great an absurdity as it is sometimes imagined to be. We generally make up our minds beforehand to the sort of person we should like, grave or gay, black, brown, or fair; with golden tresses or raven locks; --and when we meet with a complete example of the qualities we admire, the bargain is soon struck.

Lovers

A man can go from being a lover to being a stranger in three moves flat. . . but a woman under the guise of friendship will engage in acts of duplicity which come to light very much later. There are different species of self-justification.

Lovers may be --and indeed generally are --enemies, but they never can be friends, because there must always be a spice of jealousy and a something of Self in all their speculations.


Lord Byron

One who has not only the four S's, which are required in every good lover, but even the whole alphabet; as for example. . . Agreeable, Bountiful, Constant, Dutiful, Easy, Faithful, Gallant, Honorable, Ingenious, Kind, Loyal, Mild, Noble, Officious, Prudent, Quiet, Rich, Secret, True, Valiant, Wise; the X indeed, is too harsh a letter to agree with him, but he is Young and Zealous.


Miguel De Cervantes

Lovers

When a man and a woman have an overwhelming passion for each other, it seems to me, in spite of such obstacles dividing them as parents or husband, that they belong to each other in the name of Nature, and are lovers by Divine right, in spite of human convention or the laws.

There is no pain equal to that which two lovers can inflict on one another. This should be made clear to all who contemplate such a union. The avoidance of this pain is the beginning of wisdom, for it is strong enough to contaminate the rest of our lives.

------
Lovers
------

A lover, when he is admitted to cards, ought to be solemnly silent, and observe the motions of his mistress. He must laugh when she laughs, sigh when she sighs. In short, he should be the shadow of her mind. A lady, in the presence of her lover, should never want a looking-glass; as a beau, in the presence of his looking-glass, never wants a mistress.

Freedom from labor itself is not new; it once belonged among the most firmly established privileges of the few.

By his machines man can dive and remain under water like a shark; can fly like a hawk in the air; can see atoms like a gnat; can see the system of the universe of Uriel, the angel of the sun; can carry whatever loads a ton of coal can lift; can knock down cities with his fist of gunpowder; can recover the history of his race by the medals which the deluge, and every creature, civil or savage or brute, has involuntarily dropped of its existence; and divine the future possibility of the planet and its inhabitants by his perception of laws of nature.

Nature is a self-made machine, more perfectly automated than any automated machine. To create something in the image of nature is to create a machine, and it was by learning the inner working of nature that man became a builder of machines.

The cycle of the machine is now coming to an end.

The machines that are first invented to perform any particular movement are always the most complex, and succeeding artists generally discover that, with fewer wheels, with fewer principles of motion, than had originally been employed, the same effects may be more easily produced.

Madness
-------

And what is an authentic madman?  It is a man who preferred to become mad, in the socially accepted sense of the word, rather than forfeit a certain superior idea of human honor. So society has strangled in its asylums all those it wanted to get rid of or protect itself from, because they refused to become its accomplices in certain great nastinesses. For a madman is also a man whom society did not want to hear and whom it wanted to prevent from uttering certain intolerable truths.

-------
Madness
-------

One who shows signs of mental aberration is, inevitably, perhaps, but cruelly, shut off from familiar, thoughtless intercourse, partly excommunicated; his isolation is unwittingly proclaimed to him on every countenance by curiosity, indifference, aversion, or pity, and in so far as he is human enough to need free and equal communication and feel the lack of it, he suffers pain and loss of a kind and degree which others can only faintly imagine, and for the most part ignore.

In this century the writer has carried on a conversation with madness. We might almost say of the twentieth-century writer that he aspires to madness.

I love meetings with suits. I live for meetings with suits. I love them because I know they had a really boring week and I walk in there with my orange velvet leggings and drop popcorn in my cleavage and then fish it out and eat it. I like that.

--------- Magic ---------
-------------------------

The profession of magician, is one of the most perilous and arduous specialisations of the imagination. On the one hand there is the hostility of God and the police to be guarded against; on the other it is as difficult as music, as deep as poetry, as ingenious as stage-craft, as nervous as the manufacture of high explosives, and as delicate as the trade in narcotics.


William Bolitho 
1890 --1930

--------------------------
--------- Malice ---------
--------------------------

In doing good, we are generally cold, and languid, and sluggish; and of all things afraid of being too much in the right. But the works of malice and injustice are quite in another style. They are finished with a bold, masterly hand; touched as they are with the spirit of those vehement passions that call forth all our energies, whenever we oppress and persecute.


Edmund Burke 
1729 --97
Irish philosopher, statesman

Speech at Bristol, prior to the 1780 election (published in Works, vol. 2, 1899).

Malice

It is remarkable by how much a pinch of malice enhances the penetrating power of an idea or an opinion. Our ears, it seems, are wonderfully attuned to sneers and evil reports about our fellow men.

Manners

Manners are of more importance than laws. . . . Manners are what vex or soothe, corrupt or purify, exalt or debase, barbarize or refine us, by a constant, steady, uniform, insensible operation, like that of the air we breathe in.

Essays,  "History"  (First Series, 1841).


-------
Manners
-------

Manners are the happy way of doing things; each once a stroke of genius or of love --now repeated and hardened into usage. They form at last a rich varnish, with which the routine of life is washed, and its details adorned. If they are superficial, so are the dewdrops which give such depth to the morning meadows.

In truth, politeness is artificial good humor, it covers the natural want of it, and ends by rendering habitual a substitute nearly equivalent to the real virtue.


Thomas Jefferson 
1743 --1826
U.S. president

Letter, 24 Nov. 1808, to his grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph.

-------
Manners
-------

Manners are of such great consequence to the novelist that any kind will do. Bad manners are better than no manners at all, and because we are losing our customary manners, we are probably overly conscious of them; this seems to be a condition that produces writers.

The great secret, Eliza, is not having bad manners or good manners or any other particular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human souls: in short, behaving as if you were in Heaven, where there are no third-class carriages, and one soul is as good as another.

The highest perfection of politeness is only a beautiful edifice, built, from the base to the dome, of ungraceful and gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying.

--------- Mathematics ---------

How happy the lot of the mathematician!  He is judged solely by his peers, and the standard is so high that no colleague or rival can ever win a reputation he does not deserve. No cashier writes a letter to the press complaining about the incomprehensibility of Modern Mathematics and comparing it unfavorably with the good old days when mathematicians were content to paper irregularly shaped rooms and fill bathtubs without closing the waste pipe.

All science requires mathematics. The knowledge of mathematical things is almost innate in us. . . . This is the easiest of sciences, a fact which is obvious in that no one's brain rejects it; for laymen and people who are utterly illiterate know how to count and reckon.

Mathematics may be compared to a mill of exquisite workmanship, which grinds your stuff to any degree of fineness; but, nevertheless, what you get out depends on what you put in; and as the grandest mill in the world will not extract wheat flour from peascods, so pages of formulae will not get a definite result out of loose data.

Remark to a warehouse packer. Quoted in: Hester Piozzi, Anecdotes of Samuel Johnson  (1786; repr. in Johnsonian Miscellanies, vol. 1, 1897, p. 301). Mrs. Piozzi also recorded that "when Mr. Johnson felt his fancy, or fancied he felt it, disordered, his constant recurrence was to the study of arithmetic."

Nobody before the Pythagoreans had thought that mathematical relations held the secret of the universe. Twenty-five centuries later, Europe is still blessed and cursed with their heritage.

In a letter of March 1912 to Lady Ottoline Morrell, Russell wrote:  "I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental universe --because, like Spinoza's God, it won't love us in return."

Mathematics

Mathematics is not a book confined within a cover and bound between brazen clasps, whose contents it needs only patience to ransack; it is not a mine, whose treasures may take long to reduce into possession, but which fill only a limited number of veins and lodes; it is not a soil, whose fertility can be exhausted by the yield of successive harvests; it is not a continent or an ocean, whose area can be mapped out and its contour defined: it is limitless as that space which it finds too narrow for its aspirations; its possibilities are as infinite as the worlds which are forever crowding in and multiplying upon the astronomer's gaze.

Mathematics alone make us feel the limits of our intelligence. For we can always suppose in the case of an experiment that it is inexplicable because we don't happen to have all the data. In mathematics we have all the data. . . and yet we don't understand. We always come back to the contemplation of our human wretchedness. What force is in relation to our will, the impenetrable opacity of mathematics is in relation to our intelligence.

The futility of everything that comes to us from the media is the inescapable consequence of the absolute inability of that particular stage to remain silent. Music, commercial breaks, news flashes, adverts, news broadcasts, movies, presenters --there is no alternative but to fill the screen; otherwise there would be an irremediable void. . . . That's why the slightest technical hitch, the slightest slip on the part of the presenter becomes so exciting, for it reveals the depth of the emptiness squinting out at us through this little window.

When distant and unfamiliar and complex things are communicated to great masses of people, the truth suffers a considerable and often a radical distortion. The complex is made over into the simple, the hypothetical into the dogmatic, and the relative into an absolute.

---------
The Media

Commercial jazz, soap opera, pulp fiction, comic strips, the movies set the images, mannerisms, standards, and aims of the urban masses. In one way or another, everyone is equal before these cultural machines; like technology itself, the mass media are nearly universal in their incidence and appeal. They are a kind of common denominator, a kind of scheme for pre-scheduled, mass emotions.

The orthodox school has witnessed for centuries that nature itself has never once cured any existing disease with another dissimilar one, however intense. What must we think of this school, which nevertheless has continued to treat chronic diseases allopathically, with medicines and formulas that can only cause a disease condition --God knows which --dissimilar to the one being treated?  Even if these physicians have not hitherto observed nature attentively enough, the miserable results of their treatment should have taught them that they were on the wrong road.

You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realize that memory is what makes our lives.

Memory is like a purse, --if it be over-full that it cannot shut, all will drop out of it. Take heed of a gluttonous curiosity to feed on many things, lest the greediness of the appetite of thy memory spoil the digestion thereof.


Thomas Fuller 
1608 --61
English cleric

The Holy State and the Profane State, bk. 3, ch. 10 (1642).

Memory

People may correctly remember the events of twenty years ago (a remarkable feat), but who remembers his fears, his disgusts, his tone of voice?  It is like trying to bring back the weather of that time.


Martha Gellhorn

U.S. journalist, author

The Face of War,  "The War in Finland," Introduction (1959, rev. 1986).


------
Memory
------

The light of memory, or rather the light that memory lends to things, is the palest light of all. . . . I am not quite sure whether I am dreaming or remembering, whether I have lived my life or dreamed it. Just as dreams do, memory makes me profoundly aware of the unreality, the evanescence of the world, a fleeting image in the moving water.


Eugene Ionesco

Memory

Human memory is a marvelous but fallacious instrument. . . . The memories which lie within us are not carved in stone; not only do they tend to become erased as the years go by, but often they change, or even increase by incorporating extraneous features.

------
Memory

What a wonderful faculty is memory! --the most mysterious and inexplicable in the great riddle of life; that plastic tablet on which the Almighty registers with unerring fidelity the records of being, making it the depository of all our words, thoughts and deeds --this faithful witness against us for good or evil.

Our memory is like a shop in the window of which is exposed now one, now another photograph of the same person. And as a rule the most recent exhibit remains for some time the only one to be seen.

------
Memory

It's a pleasure to share one's memories. Everything remembered is dear, endearing, touching, precious. At least the past is safe --though we didn't know it at the time. We know it now. Because it's in the past; because we have survived.

The memory of most men is an abandoned cemetery where lie, unsung and unhonored, the dead whom they have ceased to cherish. Any lasting grief is reproof to their forgetfulness.

Poor little men, poor little cocks!  As soon as they're old enough, they swell their plumage to be conquerors. . . . If they only knew that it's enough to be just a little bit wounded and sad in order to obtain everything without fighting for it.

Men
---

Men are not to be told anything they might find too painful; the secret depths of human nature, the sordid physicalities, might overwhelm or damage them. For instance, men often faint at the sight of their own blood, to which they are not accustomed. For this reason you should never stand behind one in the line at the Red Cross donor clinic.

---
Men
---

Left to itself the masculine imagination has very little appreciation for the here and now; it prefers to dwell on what is absent, on what has been or may be. If men are more punctual than women, it is because they know that, without the external discipline of clock time, they would never get anything done.

Men's private self-worlds are rather like our geographical world's seasons, storm, and sun, deserts, oases, mountains and abysses, the endless-seeming plateaus, darkness and light, and always the sowing and the reaping.

Before they're plumbers or writers or taxi drivers or unemployed or journalists, before everything else, men are men. Whether heterosexual or homosexual. The only difference is that some of them remind you of it as soon as you meet them, and others wait for a little while.

Men

Providing for one's family as a good husband and father is a water-tight excuse for making money hand over fist. Greed may be a sin, exploitation of other people might, on the face of it, look rather nasty, but who can blame a man for "doing the best" for his children?

---
Men
---

The world men inhabit. . . is rather bleak. It is a world full of doubt and confusion, where vulnerability must be hidden, not shared; where competition, not co-operation, is the order of the day; where men sacrifice the possibility of knowing their own children and sharing in their upbringing, for the sake of a job they may have chosen by chance, which may not suit them and which in many cases dominates their lives to the exclusion of much else.

All men are homosexual, some turn straight. It must be very odd to be a straight man because your sexuality is hopelessly defensive. It's like an ideal of racial purity.

The male has been persuaded to assume a certain onerous and disagreeable rôle with the promise of rewards --material and psychological. Women may in the first place even have put it into his head.

Sometimes I have a notion that what might improve the situation is to have women take over the occupations of government and trade and to give men their freedom. Let them do what they are best at. While we scrawl interoffice memos and direct national or extranational affairs, men could spend all their time inventing wheels, peering at stars, composing poems, carving statues, exploring continents --discovering, reforming, or crying out in a sacramental wilderness. Efficiency would probably increase, and no one would have to worry so much about the Gaza Strip or an election.

As long as male behavior is taken to be the norm, there can be no serious questioning of male traits and behavior. A norm is by definition a standard for judging; it is not itself subject to judgment.

Since I am a man, my heart is three or four times less sensitive, because I have three or four times as much power of reason and experience of the world --a thing which you women call hard-heartedness.

I think we're a kind of desperation. We're sort of a maddening luxury. The basic and essential human is the woman, and all that we're doing is trying to brighten up the place.

--------- Men and Masculinity ---------

The masculine imagination lives in a state of perpetual revolt against the limitations of human life. In theological terms, one might say that all men, left to themselves, become gnostics. They may swagger like peacocks, but in their heart of hearts they all think sex an indignity and wish they could beget themselves on themselves. Hence the aggressive hostility toward women so manifest in most club-car stories.

Phyllis McGinley, Times Three: Selected Verse from Three Decades, Foreword (1960).


-------------------
Men and Masculinity
-------------------

The American ideal of masculinity. . . has created cowboys and Indians, good guys and bad guys, punks and studs, tough guys and softies, butch and faggot, black and white. It is an ideal so paralytically infantile that it is virtually forbidden --as an unpatriotic act --that the American boy evolves into the complexity of manhood.

-------------------
Men and Masculinity
-------------------

Because it is in the nature of things that they become extreme, we have passed down from manliness to cruelty. If I had been told when I was 20 that there was a tavern in the town where the brave and the cruel were gathered together, I would have run all the way and I would have gone up to the largest and leatheriest of the denizens and said:  "If you truly love me, kill the bartender."

-------------------
Men and Masculinity
-------------------

In this society, the norm of masculinity is phallic aggression. Male sexuality is, by definition, intensely and rigidly phallic. A man's identity is located in his conception of himself as the possessor of a phallus; a man's worth is located in his pride in phallic identity. The main characteristic of phallic identity is that worth is entirely contingent on the possession of a phallus. Since men have no other criteria for worth, no other notion of identity, those who do not have phalluses are not recognized as fully human.

Masculinity can only be experienced, achieved, recognized, and embodied in opposition to femininity. When men posit sex, violence, and death as elemental erotic truths, they mean this --that sex, or fucking, is the act which enables them to experience their own reality, or identity, or masculinity most concretely; that violence, or sadism, is the means by which they actualize that reality, or identity, or masculinity; and that death, or negation, or nothingness, or contamination by the female is what they risk each time they penetrate into what they imagine to be the emptiness of the female hole.

Men and Masculinity
-------------------

The things a man has to have are hope and confidence in himself against odds, and sometimes he needs somebody, his pal or his mother or his wife or God, to give him that confidence. He's got to have some inner standards worth fighting for or there won't be any way to bring him into conflict. And he must be ready to choose death before dishonor without making too much song and dance about it. That's all there is to it.


Clark Gable

Quoted in: Adela Rogers St. Johns, The Honeycomb (1969).


-------------------
Men and Masculinity

Unlike femininity, relaxed masculinity is at bottom empty, a limp nullity. While the female body is full of internal potentiality, the male is internally barren. . . . Manhood at the most basic level can be validated and expressed only in action.

Men were only made into "men" with great difficulty even in primitive society: the male is not naturally "a man" any more than the woman. He has to be propped up into that position with some ingenuity, and is always likely to collapse.

A woman simply is, but a man must become. Masculinity is risky and elusive. It is achieved by a revolt from woman, and it is confirmed only by other men. . . . Manhood coerced into sensitivity is no manhood at all.

-------------

The nearer society approaches to divine order, the less separation will there be in the characters, duties, and pursuits of men and women. Women will not become less gentle and graceful, but men will become more so. Women will not neglect the care and education of their children, but men will find themselves ennobled and refined by sharing those duties with them; and will receive, in return, co-operation and sympathy in the discharge of various other duties, now deemed inappropriate to women. The more women become rational companions, partners in business and in thought, as well as in affection and amusement, the more highly will men appreciate home.

Given the cultural barriers to intersex conversation, the amazing thing is that we would even expect women and men to have anything to say to each other for more than ten minutes at a stretch. The barriers are ancient --perhaps rooted, as some paleontologist may soon discover, in the contrast between the occasional guttural utterances exchanged in male hunting bands and the extended discussions characteristic of female food-gathering groups.

Coming to terms with the rhythms of women's lives means coming to terms with life itself, accepting the imperatives of the body rather than the imperatives of an artificial, man-made, perhaps transcendentally beautiful civilization.

Man is the one who desires, woman the one who is desired. This is woman's entire but decisive advantage.

Mental Illness
--------------

Doubt is to certainty as neurosis is to psychosis. The neurotic is in doubt and has fears about persons and things; the psychotic has convictions and makes claims about them. In short, the neurotic has problems, the psychotic has solutions.


Thomas Szasz 
b. 1920
U.S. psychiatrist

The Second Sin,  "Mental Illness"  (1973).


--------------
Mental Illness

No further evidence is needed to show that "mental illness" is not the name of a biological condition whose nature awaits to be elucidated, but is the name of a concept whose purpose is to obscure the obvious.

He has the lucidity which is the by-product of a fundamentally sterile mind. . . . He does not have to struggle. . . with the crowded pulsations of a fecund imagination. On the contrary he is almost devoid of imagination.

British Labour politician

Quoted in: Michael Foot, Aneurin Bevan, vol. 1, ch. 8 (1962), referring to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.

Everything tends to make us believe that there exists a certain point of the mind at which life and death, the real and the imagined, past and future, the communicable and the incommunicable, high and low, cease to be perceived as contradictions.

Sense is a line, the mind is a circle. Sense is like a line which is the flux of a point running out from itself, but intellect like a circle that keeps within itself.

U.S. founder of the Christian Science movement

Science and Health, ch. 12 (1875).


--------
The Mind
--------

The human head is bigger than the globe. It conceives itself as containing more. It can think and rethink itself and ourselves from any desired point outside the gravitational pull of the earth. It starts by writing one thing and later reads itself as something else. The human head is monstrous.

Miracles

The miracles of the church seem to me to rest not so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made finer, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always.

Mozart has the classic purity of light and the blue ocean; Beethoven the romantic grandeur which belongs to the storms of air and sea, and while the soul of Mozart seems to dwell on the ethereal peaks of Olympus, that of Beethoven climbs shuddering the storm-beaten sides of a Sinai. Blessed be they both!  Each represents a moment of the ideal life, each does us good. Our love is due to both.

It is cruel, you know, that music should be so beautiful. It has the beauty of loneliness & of pain: of strength & freedom. The beauty of disappointment & never-satisfied love. The cruel beauty of nature, & everlasting beauty of monotony.

Perhaps all music, even the newest, is not so much something discovered as something that re-emerges from where it lay buried in the memory, inaudible as a melody cut in a disc of flesh. A composer lets me hear a song that has always been shut up silent within me.

-----
Music
-----

Music and dancing (the more's the pity) have become so closely associated with ideas of riot and debauchery among the less cultivated classes, that a taste for them, for their own sakes, can hardly be said to exist, and before they can be recommended as innocent or safe amusements, a very great change of ideas must take place.

-----
Music
-----

Since music is a language with some meaning at least for the immense majority of mankind, although only a tiny minority of people are capable of formulating a meaning in it, and since it is the only language with the contradictory attributes of being at once intelligible and untranslatable, the musical creator is a being comparable to the gods, and music itself the supreme mystery of the science of man, a mystery that all the various disciplines come up against and which holds the key to their progress.


Claude Levi-Strauss 
b. 1908
French anthropologist

The Raw and the Cooked,  "Overture"  (1964).


-----
Music
-----

The musical emotion springs precisely from the fact that at each moment the composer withholds or adds more or less than the listener anticipates on the basis of a pattern that he thinks he can guess, but that he is incapable of wholly divining. . . . If the composer withholds more than we anticipate, we experience a delicious falling sensation; we feel we have been torn from a stable point on the musical ladder and thrust into the void. . . . When the composer withholds less, the opposite occurs: he forces us to perform gymnastic exercises more skillful than our own.

Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.

-----
Music
-----

The author's conviction on this day of New Year is that music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance; that poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music; but this must not be taken as implying that all good music is dance music or all poetry lyric. Bach and Mozart are never too far from physical movement.

-----------------
Music Composition

Songwriting is about getting the demon out of me. It's like being possessed. You try to go to sleep, but the song won't let you. So you have to get up and make it into something, and then you're allowed to sleep. It's always in the middle of the bloody night, or when you're half-awake or tired, when your critical faculties are switched off. So letting go is what the whole game is. Every time you try to put your finger on it, it slips away. You turn on the lights and the cockroaches run away. You can never grasp them.

A composer is a guy who goes around forcing his will on unsuspecting air molecules, often with the assistance of unsuspecting musicians.

b. 1940
U.S. rock musician

The Real Frank Zappa Book, ch. 8 (1989; written with Peter Occhiogrosso).

--------- Mystics and Mysticism ---------
-----------------------------------------

The mystic purchases a moment of exhilaration with a lifetime of confusion; and the confusion is infectious and destructive. It is confusing and destructive to try and explain anything in terms of anything else, poetry in terms of psychology.


Basil Bunting 
1900 --1985
British poet

Letter, Sept. 1932, to poet Louis Zukofsky. Quoted in: Victoria Forde, The Poetry of Basil Bunting, ch. 2 (1991).


---------------------
Mystics and Mysticism
---------------------

The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mystical. It is the power of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead. To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms --this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong to the rank of devoutly religious men.


Albert Einstein 
1879 --1955
German-born U.S. theoretical physicist

Quoted in: Philipp Frank, Einstein: His Life and Times, ch. 12, sct. 5 (1947).


---------------------
Mystics and Mysticism
---------------------

One does not become a guru by accident.


James Fenton 
b. 1949
British poet, critic

Times  (London, 9 Aug. 1984), referring to playwright Samuel Beckett.


---------------------
Mystics and Mysticism
---------------------

Uncontrolled, the hunger and thirst after God may become an obstacle, cutting off the soul from what it desires. If a man would travel far along the mystic road, he must learn to desire God intensely but in stillness, passively and yet with all his heart and mind and strength.


Aldous Huxley 
1894 --1963
British author

Grey Eminence, ch. 9 (1941).


---------------------
Mystics and Mysticism
---------------------

We follow the mystics. They know where they are going. They, too, go astray, but when they go astray they do so in a way that is mystical, dark, and mysterious.


Ryszard Kapuscinski 
b. 1932
Polish journalist

 "A Warsaw Diary" in Granta, no. 15 (Cambridge, England, 1985).


---------------------
Mystics and Mysticism
---------------------

Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God.


Soren Kierkegaard 
1813 --1855
Danish philosopher

Either/Or, vol. 2,  "Balance between Esthetic and Ethical"  (1843; tr. 1987).


---------------------
Mystics and Mysticism
---------------------

Mysticism and exaggeration go together. A mystic must not fear ridicule if he is to push all the way to the limits of humility or the limits of delight.


Milan Kundera 
b. 1929
Czech author, critic

The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, pt. 3, ch. 2 (1978; tr. 1980).


---------------------
Mystics and Mysticism
---------------------

What does mysticism really mean?  It means the way to attain knowledge. It's close to philosophy, except in philosophy you go horizontally while in mysticism you go vertically.


Elie Wiesel 
b. 1928
Rumanian-born U.S. writer

Interview in Writers at Work  (Eighth Series, ed. by George Plimpton, 1988).


---------------------
Mystics and Mysticism
---------------------

Mysticism has been in the past & probably ever will be one of the great powers of the world & it is bad scholarship to pretend the contrary. You may argue against it but you should no more treat it with disrespect than a perfectly cultivated writer would treat (say) the Catholic Church or the Church of Luther no matter how much he disliked them.


W. B. Yeats 
1865 --1939
Irish poet, playwright

Letter, 10 Oct. 1893, to author Laurence Housman (published in Collected Letters, vol. 1, ed. by John Kelly, 1986). In an earlier letter (23 July 1892), Yeats had written:  "The mystical life is the centre of all that I do & all that I think & all that I write. . . . I have always considered myself a voice of what I believe to be a greater renaissance --the revolt of the soul against the intellect."

------------------------
--------- Myth ---------
------------------------

Myth is neither a lie nor a confession: it is an inflexion.


Roland Barthes 
1915 --80
French semiologist

Mythologies,  "Myth Today: Reading and Deciphering Myth"  (1957; tr. 1972).


----
Myth
----

Myth is the hidden part of every story, the buried part, the region that is still unexplored because there are as yet no words to enable us to get there. . . . Myth is nourished by silence as well as by words.


Italo Calvino 
1923 --85
Italian author, critic

 "Cybernetics and Ghosts," lecture, Nov. 1969, Turin (published in The Literature Machine, 1987).


----
Myth
----

There is nothing truer than myth: history, in its attempt to "realize" myth, distorts it, stops halfway; when history claims to have "succeeded," this is nothing but humbug and mystification. Everything we dream is "realizable."  Reality does not have to be: it is simply what it is.


Eugene Ionesco 
b. 1912
Rumanian-born French playwright

 "Experience of the Theatre," in Nouvelle N.R.F, no. 62 (Paris, 1958; repr. in Notes and Counter Notes, 1962).


----
Myth
----

The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie --deliberate, contrived and dishonest --but the myth --persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.


John F. Kennedy 
1917 --63
U.S. Democratic politician, president

Commencement address, 11 June 1962, Yale University, New Haven, Conn.


----
Myth
----

Myth is an attempt to narrate a whole human experience, of which the purpose is too deep, going too deep in the blood and soul, for mental explanation or description.


D. H. Lawrence 
1885 --1930
British author

 "Introduction to The Dragon of the Apocalypse by Frederick Carter," in London Mercury  (July 1930; repr. in Phoenix: The Posthumous Papers of D. H. Lawrence, pt. 4, ed. by E. McDonald, 1936). Carter's book eventually appeared under a different title and without Lawrence's introduction.

I therefore claim to show, not how men think in myths, but how myths operate in men's minds without their being aware of the fact.

----
Myth

It is a sure sign that a culture has reached a dead end when it is no longer intrigued by its myths.


Greil Marcus 
b. 1945
U.S. rock journalist

Mystery Train,  "Elvis: Presliad"  (1976).


----
Myth
----

The primary function of myth is to validate an existing social order. Myth enshrines conservative social values, raising tradition on a pedestal. It expresses and confirms, rather than explains or questions, the sources of cultural attitudes and values. . . . Because myth anchors the present in the past it is a sociological charter for a future society which is an exact replica of the present one.

b. 1944

Sometimes legends make reality, and become more useful than the facts.


Salman Rushdie 
b. 1947
Indian-born British author

Midnight's Children, bk. 1,  "Hit-the-spittoon"  (1981).


----
Myth
----

All the great things have been denied and we live in an intricacy of new and local mythologies, political, economic, poetic, which are asserted with an ever-enlarging incoherence.


Wallace Stevens 
1879 --1955
U.S. poet

The Necessary Angel,  "The Noble Rider and the Sound of Words"  (1951; first published 1942).


----
Myth
----

The poets were not alone in sanctioning myths, for long before the poets the states and the lawmakers had sanctioned them as a useful expedient. . . . They needed to control the people by superstitious fears, and these cannot be aroused without myths and marvels.


Strabo 
c. 58 B.C. -c. 24 A.D.

Greek geographer

Geographia, bk. 1, sct. 2, subsct. 8.


----
Myth
----

Myths and legends die hard in America. We love them for the extra dimension they provide, the illusion of near-infinite possibility to erase the narrow confines of most men's reality. Weird heroes and mould-breaking champions exist as living proof to those who need it that the tyranny of "the rat race" is not yet final.


Hunter S. Thompson 
b. 1939
U.S. journalist

 "Those Daring Young Men in their Flying Machines. . . Ain't What They Used to Be!" in Pageant  (Sept. 1969; repr. in The Great Shark Hunt, pt. 3, 1979).

--------- Names ---------

Proper names are poetry in the raw. Like all poetry they are untranslatable.


W. H. Auden 
1907 --73
Anglo-American poet

A Certain World,  "Names, Proper"  (1970).


-----
Names
-----

Miss. A title with which we brand unmarried women to indicate that they are in the market. Miss, Missis (Mrs.) and Mister (Mr.) are the three most distinctly disagreeable words in the language, in sound and sense. Two are corruptions of Mistress, the other of Master. . . . If we must have them, let us be consistent and give one to the unmarried man. I venture to suggest Mush, abbreviated to Mh.


Ambrose Bierce 
1842 --1914
U.S. author

The Devil's Dictionary  (1881 --1906).


-----

In real life, unlike in Shakespeare, the sweetness of the rose depends upon the name it bears. Things are not only what they are. They are, in very important respects, what they seem to be.


Hubert H. Humphrey 
1911 --78
U.S. Democratic politician, vice president

Speech, 26 March 1966, Washington, D.C.


-----
Names
-----

These names: gay, queer, homosexual are limiting. I would love to finish with them. We're going to have to decide which terms to use and where we use them. . . . For me to use the word "queer" is a liberation; it was a word that frightened me, but no longer.


Derek Jarman 
b. 1942
British filmmaker, artist, author

At Your Own Risk: A Saint's Testament,  "1950's"  (1992).


-----
Names
-----

To name oneself is the first act of both the poet and the revolutionary. When we take away the right to an individual name, we symbolically take away the right to be an individual. Immigration officials did this to refugees; husbands routinely do it to wives.


Erica Jong

I think a child should be allowed to take his father's or mother's name at will on coming of age. Paternity is a legal fiction.


James Joyce 
1882 --1941
Irish author

Letter, 18 Sept. 1905, to his brother Stanislaus (published in Selected Letters, ed. by Richard Ellmann, 1975).


-----
Names
-----

I shall write a book some day about the appropriateness of names. Geoffrey Chaucer has a ribald ring, as is proper and correct, and Alexander Pope was inevitably Alexander Pope. Colley Cibber was a silly little man without much elegance and Shelley was very Percy and very Bysshe.


James Joyce 
1882 --1941
Irish author

Quoted in: Frederic Prokosch, Voices: A Memoir,  "At Sylvia's"  (1983). Joyce was replying to a question from the young author and poet Prokosch,  "What do you think of Virginia Woolf?" Joyce answered that it was "an impressive name. . . she married her wolfish husband purely in order to change her name. Virginia Stephens is not a name for an exploratory authoress."


-----
Names
-----

We don't know when our name came into being or how some distant ancestor acquired it. We don't understand our name at all, we don't know its history and yet we bear it with exalted fidelity, we merge with it, we like it, we are ridiculously proud of it as if we had thought it up ourselves in a moment of brilliant inspiration.


Milan Kundera 
b. 1929
Czech author, critic

Agnes, in Immortality, pt. 1, ch. 7 (1991).


-----
Names
-----

I don't like your miserable lonely single "front name."  It is so limited, so meagre; it has no versatility; it is weighted down with the sense of responsibility; it is worn threadbare with much use; it is as bad as having only one jacket and one hat; it is like having only one relation, one blood relation, in the world. Never set a child afloat on the flat sea of life with only one sail to catch the wind.


D. H. Lawrence 
1885 --1930
British author

Letter, 13 May 1908 (published in The Letters of D. H. Lawrence, vol. 1, ed. by James T. Boulton, 1979). Lawrence added,  "I am called Bertie, Bert, David, Herbert, Billy, William and Dick; I am a full-rigged schooner; I have a wardrobe as complete as the man's-about-town."

I sometimes think I was born to live up to my name. How could I be anything else but what I am having been named Madonna?  I would either have ended up a nun or this.

-----

I came to live in a country I love; some people label me a defector. I have loved men and women in my life; I've been labelled "the bisexual defector" in print. Want to know another secret?  I'm even ambidextrous. I don't like labels. Just call me Martina.

-----
Names
-----

It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is with words. . . . The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It is the only thing he is fit for.

Lord Henry, in The Picture of Dorian Gray, ch. 17 (1891).

------------------------------------
--------- Names: Nicknames ---------

A nickname is the heaviest stone that the devil can throw at a man. It is a bugbear to the imagination, and, though we do not believe in it, it still haunts our apprehensions.


William Hazlitt 
1778 --1830
English essayist

Sketches and Essays,  "On Nicknames"  (1839).


----------------
Names: Nicknames
----------------

In its purest sense, nicknaming is an elitist ritual practiced by those who cherish hierarchy. For preppies it's a smoke signal that allows Bunny to tell Pooky that they belong to the same tribe, while among the good ole boys it serves the cause of masculine dominance by identifying Bear and Wrecker as Alpha males.

-----
Night
-----

Night is a dead monotonous period under a roof; but in the open world it passes lightly, with its stars and dews and perfumes, and the hours are marked by changes in the face of Nature. What seems a kind of temporal death to people choked between walls and curtains, is only a light and living slumber to the man who sleeps afield.

----
Pain
----

There is much pain that is quite noiseless; and vibrations that make human agonies are often a mere whisper in the roar of hurrying existence. There are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of murder; robberies that leave man or woman for ever beggared of peace and joy, yet kept secret by the sufferer --committed to no sound except that of low moans in the night, seen in no writing except that made on the face by the slow months of suppressed anguish and early morning tears. Many an inherited sorrow that has marred a life has been breathed into no human ear.

Strictly speaking, there is but one real evil: I mean acute pain. All other complaints are so considerably diminished by time that it is plain the grief is owing to our passion, since the sensation of it vanishes when that is over.

Pain is real when you get other people to believe in it. If no one believes in it but you, your pain is madness or hysteria.

--------- Painting ---------
----------------------------

Painting throughout its history has served many purposes, has been flat and has used perspective, has been framed and has been left borderless, has been explicit and has been mysterious. But one act of faith has remained a constant. . . . The act of faith consisted in believing that the visible contained hidden secrets, that to study the visible was to learn something more than could be seen in a glance. . . . Jackson Pollock was driven by a despair which was partly his and partly that of the times which nourished him, to refuse this act of faith: to insist, with all his brilliance as a painter, that there was nothing behind, that there was only that which was done to the canvas on the side facing us.

It is impossible for me to envisage a picture as being other than a window, and why my first concern is then to know what it looks out on.

You must recollect however that I know nothing of painting & that I detest it, unless it reminds me of something I have seen or think it possible to see. . . . Depend upon it of all the arts it is the most artificial & unnatural --& that by which the nonsense of mankind is the most imposed upon.


Lord Byron 
1788 --1824
English poet

Letter, 14 April 1817, to the publisher John Murray (published in Byron's Letters and Journals, vol. 5, 1973 --81).


--------
Painting

The foreground in a picture is always unattractive. . . Art demands that the interest of the canvas should be placed in the far distance, where lies take refuge, those dreams which blossom out of fact and are man's only love.


Louis-Ferdinand Celine

If you pick up some paint with your brush and make somebody's nose with it, this is rather ridiculous when you think of it, theoretically or philosophically. It's really absurd to make an image, like a human image, with paint, today.

Dutch-born U.S. artist

 "Painting As Self Discovery," interview, 30 Dec. 1960, BBC (first published as "Content Is a Glimpse. . .," in Location, New York, Spring 1963). Quoted in: Diane Waldman, William de Kooning  (1988).

The studio has become the crucible where human genius at the apogee of its development brings back to question not only that which is, but creates anew a fantastic and conventional nature which our weak minds, impotent to harmonize it with existing things, adopt by preference, because the miserable work is our own.

My weakness has always been to prefer the large intention of an unskilful artist to the trivial intention of an accomplished one: in other words, I am more interested in the high ideas of a feeble executant than in the high execution of a feeble thinker.

--------
Painting
--------

Painting consumes labour not disproportionate to its effect; but a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make something in stone that hardly resembles a man. The value of statuary is owing to its difficulty. You would not value the finest head cut upon a carrot.

The method of painting is the natural growth out of a need. I want to express my feelings rather than illustrate them. Technique is just a means of arriving at a statement. . . . I can control the flow of paint: there is no accident, just as there is no beginning and no end.

It gets to seem as if way back in the Garden of Eden after the Fall, Adam and Eve had begged the Lord to forgive them and He, in his boundless exasperation, had said,  "All right, then. Stay. Stay in the Garden. Get civilized. Procreate. Muck it up."  And they did.

Letter, 1 July 1925, to F. Scott Fitzgerald, describing Fitzgerald's version of heaven (published in Ernest Hemingway: Selected Letters, 1981).

-------
Passion
-------

To hide a passion totally (or even to hide, more simply, its excess) is inconceivable: not because the human subject is too weak, but because passion is in essence made to be seen: the hiding must be seen: I want you to know that I am hiding something from you, that is the active paradox I must resolve: at one and the same time it must be known and not known: I want you to know that I don't want to show my feelings: that is the message I address to the other.

-------
Passion
-------

What is passion?  It is surely the becoming of a person. Are we not, for most of our lives, marking time?  Most of our being is at rest, unlived. In passion, the body and the spirit seek expression outside of self. Passion is all that is other from self. Sex is only interesting when it releases passion. The more extreme and the more expressed that passion is, the more unbearable does life seem without it. It reminds us that if passion dies or is denied, we are partly dead and that soon, come what may, we will be wholly so.
