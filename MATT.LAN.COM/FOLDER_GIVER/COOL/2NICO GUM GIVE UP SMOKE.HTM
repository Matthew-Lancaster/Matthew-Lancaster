Do you want to live in the Darkside all your life
I was a hardened Smoker To embarrest to say how long
Now I say tobacco firm stick that firm one up your ass.
I only done it coz I loved POT
I didnt like tobacco being the carrier of POT
I didnt like smoking being an in-between thing 
when criminality make's it hard to get POT
Carrier

Cigerette
Crimminal
Cannabis
Cancer
Car

Potty Training Pot Ass Crack Brown Eye

Darkside - Black Tar Oil Pipeline

Bird flu - Chimney Breast Flu

In the news recent the talk of smoking Ban
notice they let the smokers have the last say
"Were gona die anyway"
Oh next best thing to euthanasia
Its like with Trips Some cunt jumps off a building good luck to him another
tosser lost it
Its like with Schizo's Some cunt claims he's Mad Mike and can memorize a newspaper
in 5 mins then goes and kills someone who gives jib - another tosser Lost it
Need i say more.
you useless cunt in the fight against world domination by
British american tobacco companys and governments
I worked hard and relized sense and I'm still here
to tell the tale so I'm telling you.

The phamflet for nico gum-----------------
mentions things like
Craving - Just another word for Raving Mad
Urges
Inability to concentrate
wont Give Buzz Like cig's do
Encouragement from doctor friends can make less stressful and more successful
Do not use gum if continue to smoke bullshit. just dont chew gum and smoke
Only use a patch if you got false teeth and cant chew
Get your current meds adjusted when givin up bullshit they dont
they say smoking decreases the effectiveness of meds they dont increase
but they wont reduce
They say giving up smoking makes you more phychotic so increase meds
Dont bother letting the gum rest and go back to it so you dont get too much rush 
bullshit we like rush
Keep the gum resting in Check - Bullshit Gum Bum Cheek Ass Hole Black Hole Darkside
How many gums should I use and how long
Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit 
Pick the right day to give up - You dont know when the bird flu sign to give up 
will hit so take one day at a time
Remove temptation
Bullshit you know when you give up the last thing your ever want is a cig again
Take one day at a time - think that thought might help if you start again - Bullshit
Get some exercise - Yer nothing more than a walk
Think cash not ash - OK thats a good one
You wont Relapse
You will Succeed

I laugh how easy this System is to give up smoking
If Only I knew Earlier

People say hypno threapy is the only way coz the gums your still addicted
to the nicotine then you have to give them up as well after you gave up
smoking - Bullshit.

This is for the Pro Smokers come on now there are people that want to give up
you know we have got Bird Flu now - dont you think its about time
Here's a fav saying of mine -
Rub some sandpaper Down your Lungs

One thing when you give up you acutually Dream better you know you can wave
goodbye to those nightmares

Cigerette
Smurfet
Woman - Make's you think doesnt It

I'm too sexy for my cigerettes

The thing I Liked about smoking Or rather not
Specially with roll ups
about every 50 cigs you get that waff of purfume smell amost as if you
are hullcinating smell sense, just lasts a couple seconds
another toke is not the same
it nothing like as if you just put some aftershave on and it rubbed onto
the cig
its just a stunt by the tobacco firm to keep you fooled into being hooked

Actually I been walk up the downs recent come accross some campers camp fires
they seem to have the nice purfume smell with that so it must be a natrual
thing

You know you made the first Step in improving when you can have a shit in
the morning before a cig - think about that I did

Bill Hicks Quotes I love this man Kept me a happy smoker for so long
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"How much do you smoke, sir? A pack a day? Why don't you just put on a
dress and swish around ... I go through two lighters a day."

"The war on drugs to me is absolutely phoney; it's so obviously phoney,
OK? It's a war against our civil rights, that's all it is. They're using
it to make us afraid to go out at night, afraid of each other, so that we
lock ourselves in our homes and they get to suspend our rights one by one."

"Why is pot against the law? It wouldn't be because anyone can grow it,
and therefore you can't make a profit off it, would it?"

---

It took me 4 months and 735 nicorette chewing gums mostly 2mg type not 4mg
there too strong
well it took half that to give up I just carried on taking them afterwards
just to make sure for fun like you could say

Very nice gum much better than the sugarfree cheap gums you get in the shop
that still burn your tongue after 12 hours

Though the NICO gum do go hard quicker

I gave up December 2003

First off I started the gums whenever I felt like a cig
in the first month on average I had 3 or 4 a day sometimes none 
once or twice 7 and in that first month which I must say I bought 105 4mg's 

After a month I actually got round to having a gum before I had a cig in a day

Always trying to beat my record I made a note's 
all the time cutting off the used part of the gum packet strips so I could make a note 
of how many I had at the end of every day or in the morning.

I starved my body of nicotine which resulted in me getting the usual smokers
bird flue symptoms just like a heroin addict gets when starved of heroin on
that day I had very few gums an never smoked a cig all day and that was when
I gave up I carried on with another 360 gums for a month an half afterwards 
just to make sure I had really given up

I had a few spare 4mg gums the last one I took while up late on the computer
put my head in a spin

I got a half pint cup and put the used gums in that, That I used to give up 
and another one for after, giving up as a trophy on the window ledge 
above my curtains along with a couple of backy tins.

The most gums I had in a day before giving up was 12 in 10 hours before a cig
the most after giving up in a day was 14. both those times were one off's

People used to say 'wana a cig' I say Nar Neat Nicotine.

The NICO gum are expensive but a worth while investment your feel better
almost immediately as soon as you given up

The big boxes of gum come in 105 pieces a box at around £17 a box.
it's best to start givin up in summer I got a deal on gum 2 for 1 but not
in winter on turn of year when everyone wants to give up.

Took me just 4 months to give up with gums
not long compared to the amount of time I was smoking

If you want to do this make sure it is essential that you must sleep every
single night of the process

If I go in hospital like I have I will spend time in smoking room I spend
time in every room, the second hand smoke takes about 3 months to get off 
your chest under those circumstances.

I always heard that after 5 years your be healthly as a non smoker but
infact I heard that time last upto 15 years and think all the second
hand smoke you breathe in that time will alway increase the lenght of time

I heard from a next door neightbour demolition worker he was taught that
asbestos fibers are like tiny hooks and get one caught in your lung can spell
trouble he said the way to prevent it is not to brethe heavy when around
the stuff

Hope this helps.
