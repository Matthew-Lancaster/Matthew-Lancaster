<p>Once upon a time there was no planetary system, just a cloud of dust and gas moving around a central region that was collapsing and becoming the Sun. Little by little, however, the dust and gas gathered into larger pieces, which slowly collected into world-sized bodies.</p>

<p>As the pieces grew larger, their gravitational fields grew more intense and the mutual collisions became harder and more forceful Finally, when most of the material had collected into a large, solid sphere, the last large pieces that joined that sphere came down with a crash that kicked up vast craters.</p>

<p>The Moon is covered with such craters, as we have known for nearly four centuries. In the last decade, we have discovered that Mercury is covered with them, too, as is Mars and even the two tiny satellites of Mars. The first very crude close-up pictures of Ganymede, the largest satellite of Jupiter, indicate the presence of craters. Venus, under its obscuring clouds, probably possesses them, too.</p>

<p>But what about Earth? Was our world not formed by gradually strengthening collisions as the others were? Should there not be the marks of those last impacts upon it?</p>

<p>There would be, if Earth weren't different from the others. Unlike the other worlds I've mentioned, it has an ocean which can absorb an impact and remain unmarked. Rain, rivers, wind, and, most of all, the busy bustle of living things act to erase any impact marks that form on land.</p>

<p>Even so, there are some signs. There are worn-down, waterlogged circular patches visible from the air here and there on Earth, and these may be the remains of ancient craters. In Arizona, about 30 kilometers west of the town of Winslow, there is an actual crater which must have been gouged out by the impact of a thudding meteorite some thousands of tonnes in weight. The hole is 1,200 meters wide and 800 meters deep and is called "Meteor Crater."</p>

<p>Why is Meteor Crater still there? First, because it is recent. The meteorite that formed it may have fallen as recently as ten thousand years ago. Secondly, it fell in a desert area where the action of water and life is minimal.</p>

<p>And has anything happened since Meteor Crater was formed?</p>

<p>Impacts are not as likely to take place now, as in primordial days. After all, the space near the worlds that now exist has been swept comparatively clean by the catastrophes of the past. Every mark on the Moon is the result of a fragment of rock we don't have to worry about any more.</p>

<p>Yet space is not entirely clean. There are known objects up to 25 kilometers across that can approach within 25 million kilometers of Earth. These won't actually collide with us, but there must be large numbers of minor bodies, much smaller, that come much closer. These small bodies are not likely to be seen at all until they enter the atmosphere. And though they're small compared to the monsters that were common in the past, they're still large enough to do enormous damage on the human scale.</p>

<p>The potential is there, then - but has anything happened?</p>

<p>We might speculate about some of the legendary catastrophes of the past Did a meteorite speed into the Persian Gulf and splash half its content of water into the Tigris-Euphrates valley - and was that the origin of the tale of Noah's flood? Was it a meteorite, or a group of them, that fell on Sodom and Gomorrah and destroyed them with fire from heaven?</p>

<p>We can't say. We don't know. We may never know.</p>

<p>But is there anything that happened that is more than speculation? - Yes, there is.</p>

<p>Once, and only once, in known history was there a clear and documented event that looked as though a large meteorite had fallen on Earth. It took place only seven decades ago, in 1908, in Siberia.</p>

<p>It was an amazing fall. On the one hand, it did enormous damage, for it fell in a forest and knocked down every tree for scores of miles in every direction. On the other hand, it did very little damage, for it killed not one human being.</p>

<p>Consider how unusual that had to be.</p>

<p>Seventy per cent of the Earth's surface is water. If that fall had taken place anywhere in the ocean, tsunamis (so-called "tidal waves") would have washed the nearer shores and done much damage. Another 10 per cent of the Earth's surface is covered by permanent ice. If the fall had taken place there, enough melting might just barely have come about to cause the slippage of large quantities of ice into the ocean, bringing about catastrophic changes in Earth's sea level and climate.</p>

<p>At least 15 per cent of what is left of Earth's surface is populated, more or less thickly, with human beings; and is littered, more or less thoroughly, with the products of their civilization. If the fall had taken place there, anywhere from hundreds to millions of people would have been killed and anywhere from thousands to billions of dollars of damage would have been inflicted. The fall would have completely wiped out any city it had struck. Perhaps not more than 5 per cent of the surface of the Earth could have received that 1908 blow without any damage at all being done to human life and property. And, with the odds twenty to one against it, that fall took place safely (from the human standpoint).</p>

<p>By the same token, though, the place in which the fall occurred was inaccessible (else it would have been populated) and it was years before the vicinity could be examined. It was only then that the real mystery began. I won't tell you what that was, because that is what the book is about, and the book tells it better than I can.</p>

<p>Baxter and Atkins tell the story with great skill; doing it methodically, in order and in detail, taking every factor into account, and going about the process, very rationally, of making an absorbing suspense tale out of it. And in the end, they come up with a dramatic solution indeed.</p>

<p>You may not accept the authors' solution, for it is reached by elimination and by uncertain report, rather than by direct evidence (which, by the nature of things, cannot exist), and such a line of argument is always shaky. But think about it - In the light of the authors' solution, consider that the fall managed to find a one-in-twenty place where it would do no damage, almost as though someone was humanely trying to avoid - But read the book! I loved every page of it!</p>
