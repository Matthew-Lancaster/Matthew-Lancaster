<p>This book tells the story of an explosion that occurred almost seventy years ago in the remote wilds of central Siberia. It is essentially a mystery story, for though the blast was among the most powerful ever occurring before or since on earth, its exact cause is not known; it remains today one of the greatest scientific riddles of all time. In telling the story, we have decided to let the mystery unfold chronologically, to relate the events as they happened and to allow the people involved to speak for themselves, particularly the eyewitnesses whose words provide a graphic record not only of the event itself but of their terror in the face of an inexplicable catastrophe.</p>

<p>The book is also a chronicle of history, covering five decades of expeditions to the Tunguska region in Siberia and all of the major theories offered to explain the blast The evolution of modern science plays a crucial role in the narrative, as each generation of investigators attempts to cope, within the limits of its knowledge, with the extraordinary facts of the event. The members of the small, ill-equipped early expeditions were like detectives working with hopelessly primitive tools to solve a crime that was beyond their understanding; yet even the most recent expeditions, large teams of experts aided by the most sophisticated detection equipment, have been baffled by the complexity of the evidence and the tremendous magnitude of the blast.</p>

<p>The unparalleled nature of the Siberian explosion is illustrated by comparison with the most violent natural explosions of history, such as those that destroyed Thera, Pompeii, or Krakatoa. The advent of the atomic age provides man-made comparisons, but scientists find that even the awesome nuclear fire unleashed by the bomb dropped from the 6-29 Enola Gay in 1945 over Hiroshima is dwarfed by the force of the 1908 blast. Only the later thermonuclear tests conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union can approach it in sheer size and scope.</p>

<p>The search for the identity of the mysterious "cosmic body" that caused the Siberian explosion involves mankind's oldest science, astronomy, as well as basic issues of cosmology dealing with what astronomer Fred Hoyle has called "the universal game that is going on around us, the game of which we are perhaps a tiny part." At the beginning of this century, at the time of the explosion, the extent of the universe was believed to be our galaxy; and the study of celestial objects such as meteorites and comets was then in its infancy. By the 1970s, however, astrophysics and space technology provide an expanded vision of a turbulent and infinite metagalactic universe full of bizarre objects like particles of "antimatter" and collapsed stars called "black holes" which defy the established laws of physics. Each of these newly discovered phenomena is examined as a possible answer to the Siberian puzzle.</p>

<p>In Russia the event has acquired an almost legendary status. In addition to hundreds of scientific papers, the great blast has inspired countless stories, poems, films, and television programs. A bibliography compiled in 1969 by a Soviet periodical listed more than a thousand items published about the catastrophe of 1908.</p>

<p>In our research we have concentrated primarily on original Russian scientific sources, which have the most reliable, accurate accounts of the event. With the help of our translator, John W. Atwell, we have been able to include new material and information not previously available in English. Although for the sake of readability, we have not used footnotes in the text, a full bibliography of references appears at the end of the book. Also included are two primary documents, translated especially for this volume, containing important eyewitness descriptions of the event.</p>

<p>Finally, like all mysteries, the Siberian explosion beckons to be answered and put to rest. In the last chapters we present the latest findings of Soviet scientists and then, after providing a cosmological justification for our conclusion, attempt a reconstruction of the morning that the fire came by.</p>
