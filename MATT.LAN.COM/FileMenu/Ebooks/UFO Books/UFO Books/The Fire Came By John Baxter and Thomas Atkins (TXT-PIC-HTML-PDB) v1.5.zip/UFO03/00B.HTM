<p>The authors wish to express their appreciation first of all to their translator, John W. Atwell, associate professor of Russian history at Hollins College, Virginia; his expert assistance and advice on this project were invaluable. Other translations were undertaken by Laird Ekland. Next, Larry Ashmead must be thanked for proposing the idea for the book and giving us generous support and encouragement. Mary Ellen O'Brien made many useful suggestions that influenced the shape of the manuscript, and R.H.W. Dillard was helpful in matters of cosmology.</p>

<p>We owe a debt of gratitude to the staff of the Hollins College Library, particularly to Shirley Henn who patiently handled all of our numerous and often obscure requests for inter-library loan articles and books. Careful typing and proofreading of the manuscript were done by Eileen Montgomery. We are also grateful to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the New York City Public Library, the Library of the University of Missouri at Columbia, and the St. Louis Public Library where we conducted some of our research.</p>
