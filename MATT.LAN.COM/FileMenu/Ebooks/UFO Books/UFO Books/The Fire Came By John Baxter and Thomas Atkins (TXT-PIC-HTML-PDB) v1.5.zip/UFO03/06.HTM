<p>To the surprise of his debunkers, Kulik returned from the grueling ordeal of the 1927 expedition in triumph - or at least what seemed like triumph at the time. The solid evidence he had acquired impressed the Soviet Academy of Sciences and quashed the skepticism and indifference with which many scientists had previously greeted stories of the strange superblast. A catastrophic explosion rumored to have occurred almost two decades ago in the remote forests of central Siberia became, because of Kulik's firsthand documentation, an undeniable and even somewhat overwhelming reality that quickly aroused the fascination of experts not only in Russia but around the globe.</p>

<p>As his accomplishments were publicized, Kulik's reputation gradually changed from that of a relatively obscure meteorite researcher to that of a pioneering figure of growing international prestige. His report delivered in December of 1927 to the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences reflected his own picture of his place in history and his stubborn belief in the importance of financing immediate further investigation of the remarkable event:</p>

<p>For seven years I have been holding the view that since this fall occurred on the territory of the Soviet Union, we are in duty bound to study it If the matter was delayed until last year on the pretext that it was all pure fancy, this objection has now been swept away, since the positive results of my expedition are irrefutable. Their unique scientific significance, like the significance of the Tunguska fall itself, will be fully appreciated only in history and it is necessary to record all the remaining traces of this fall for posterity.</p>

<p>In addition to extensive coverage in Russian and European newspapers, articles appeared in the New York Times and the London Times featuring the Tunguska expedition and quoting Kulik's descriptions of the "blasted" and "bombarded" impact site. The mysterious explosion also received considerable attention in popular astronomy and science magazines as well as serious scientific journals. As the event became internationally known, additional records of huge seismic shocks and air turbulence in 1908 were uncovered and sent from other countries to the Soviet Academy. The magnitude of the blast was further confirmed when it was determined from worldwide barographic records that its air waves had traveled twice around the earth.</p>

<p>For the next several years exploratory trips to the fall region, under Kulik's direction, became almost annual events. On the second Tunguska expedition, begun in April of 1928, Kulik was joined by zoologist V. Sytin and Sovkino cinematographer N. Strukov from Moscow. In addition to filming graphic examples of the shattered forest, Strukov shot a hazardous river crossing in which Kulik nearly drowned. The accident occurred on some narrow, rocky rapids on the Chamb6 River where the group was forced to unload their boats and carry all the equipment across the water; as Kulik was pushing his boat across, it overturned and knocked him down. Only the fact that his foot became entangled in a mooring line prevented him from being swept downstream. Clinging to the boat, he pulled himself to the bank and emerged safely, still wearing his spectacles.</p>

<p>After arriving at the Southern Swamp, the group explored a wider area around the fall point and conducted a magnetic survey, hoping to detect traces of meteorite fragments imbedded in the peat. Although some Tungus had reported finding unusual bits of shiny metal "brighter than the blade of a knife and resembling in color a silver coin," Kulik's primitive magnetic instruments detected nothing. The team tried to dig into the large circular depressions, which he was sure were craters caused by meteorite fragments, but the water and boggy soil made penetration almost impossible without boring and draining equipment.</p>

<p>A third and better-equipped expedition, departing in February of 1929 and remaining in the wilderness for eighteen months, also concentrated on studying the Southern Swamp, particularly the crater-like pits and the huge peat folds or ridges which Kulik believed were formed by "the enormous lateral pressure of the explosion gases which emanated from the meteorite." Despite elaborate trench digging, excavations, and boring with large hand drills to depths of 25 yards, no proof was found to support this notion. The possibility that the pits and ridges were simply natural formations of the central Siberian landscape, caused by the thawing of the permafrost beneath the peat, had occurred to other scientists, including E.L. Krinov, a colleague on the third expedition and early authority on the Tunguska blast. Krinov, who lost a toe to frostbite on this expedition, believed that Kulik might have been more successful had he not focused his attention almost exclusively on what he was convinced lay hidden beneath the marshy turf of the Southern Swamp and instead broadened his scope to the larger region of the wind-fallen taiga.</p>

<p>But for the next decade Kulik obstinately persisted in his conviction that under the swamp lay "crushed masses of ... nickeliferous iron, individual pieces of which may have a weight of one or two hundred metric tons." The original meteorite, he estimated, probably weighed, before falling into the earth's atmosphere, "as much as several thousands of metric tons." His companion on the second expedition Sytin guessed that the value of the metal might be between 100 and 200 million dollars, chiefly for the iron and platinum. Following the 1928 trip to central Siberia, Kulik had given a lecture, accompanied by Strukov's motion picture of the Tunguska destruction, to a Moscow audience that, according to the New York Times, "shivered" as he outlined one of the more alarming implications of the event:</p>

<p>Astronomers and geologists know that this was an exceptional circumstance. But they know also that there is no reason whatever why a similar visitation should not fall at any moment upon a more populous region.</p>

<p>Thus, had this meteorite fallen in Central Belgium, there would have been no living creature left in the whole country; on London, none left alive in South [of] Manchester or East [of] Bristol. Had it fallen on New York, Philadelphia might have escaped with only its windows shattered, and New Haven and Boston escaped, too. But all life in the central area of the meteor's impact would have been blotted out instantaneously.</p>

<p>Similarly, a Moscow newspaper speculated about the harrowing possibility of a repeat of the blast:</p>

<p>The fall of this meteor in the trackless Siberian forest did nothing more than provide a new legend to the local savages. But how can we know that another will not strike Moscow, London, or New York? The Siberian area was completely devastated of all life for an area of 100 square miles. In a densely populated region a similar phenomenon would be one of the most appalling catastrophes in human history.</p>

<p>The position of the 1908 explosion raised another chilling question. Anyone glancing at a global map could see that Leningrad is on the same latitude as the Tunguska cataclysm.</p>

<p>Had the event happened slightly later that morning and the earth rotated only a few more hours, would this huge city have been annihilated by a direct hit from the cosmic object?</p>

<p>In the United States, an astronomer at the Leander McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia, Charles P. Oliver, writing in 1928 for Scientific American, labeled the Siberian explosion "the most astonishing phenomenon of its kind in scientific annals" and said of Kulik's report that "one has to admit that many accounts of events in old chronicles that have been laughed at as fabrications are far less miraculous than this one, of which we seem to have undoubted confirmation."</p>

<p>The curator of meteorites at the Colorado Museum of Natural History, Harvey H. Nininger, urged his fellow astronomers and scientists to equip and send an American expedition to Russia in order to thoroughly evaluate the "unparalleled" Stony Tunguska event discovered but not explained by Kulik. Nininger stressed, in his 1933 book Our Stone-Pelted Planet, that further delay could mean the loss of invaluable physical evidence which was fading with the years and that he hoped a properly equipped group of scientific investigators would arrive in time "to secure what is yet available of the greatest message from the depths of space that has ever reached our planet."</p>

<p>While many researchers agreed about the unique opportunity presented by the Siberian event, Nininger was not able to gain financial support for an American expedition; and U.S. astronomers had to be content with reading about Kulik and the increasing number of other Soviets involved in the Tunguska research. Discussing with a British writer his lack of success, after three expeditions, in locating positive proof of a meteorite fall, Kulik pointed to the possibility that the pits in the Southern Swamp might be "the marks of a ricochet where the meteorites struck the earth a glancing blow and then flew off into space again, or perhaps vaporized on the spot." He also conceded that the meteorites might "have been connected with the comet Pons-Winnecke, or indeed they may have been the comet itself." But Kulik's inability to substantiate his speculations encouraged the advancement of other theories to account for the Tunguska catastrophe.</p>

<p>In the early 1930s two astronomers, F.J.W. Whipple, head of the Kew Observatory in London, and the Russian I. S. Astapovich, concluded independently that the celestial missile that scarred the taiga in 1908 had not been a meteorite but a gaseous comet which had left no trace of itself after impact. The absence of positive impact craters or sizable meteoritic fragments at the scene of the explosion appeared at first to support this idea. The bright atmospheric phenomena following the blast could have been caused, Astapovich contended in a 1933 article, by the dust tail of the "nucleus of a small comet" rushing toward the earth and exploding with a kinetic energy force of at least "10
<sup>21</sup> ergs per second" - more powerful than major hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and the most severe natural catastrophes. "It was this explosion that gave rise to the seismic and air waves," stated Astapovich, "while the high-temperature explosive wave caused the uniform scorching."</p>

<p>Although Astapovich came close in his estimate of the blast's tremendous release of kinetic energy - it was established in the 1960s by the Soviets to be as much as 10
<sup>28</sup> ergs, or the equivalent of about 30 million tons of TNT - the comet hypothesis, like the meteorite theory, turned out to be highly questionable. </p>

<p>Originally believed for thousands of years to be burning exhalations of the air portending great misfortune, comets are now known to be cosmic bodies pursuing elliptical orbits stretching out for billions of miles around the sun. Sometimes called "dirty snowballs," comets have nuclei composed chiefly of ice, frozen methane, and ammonia; their spectacular tails, which in the case of Halley's Comet had a length of more than 90 million miles, are always pointed away from the sun, the source of the dusty tail's glow.</p>

<p>The brilliant object that came down over Siberia, according to almost all witnesses, followed a south to north passage, and its burning trail streamed southward. There is no record, moreover, of a comet ever colliding with our planet nor any evidence that their tails cause any unusual atmospheric or magnetic phenomena such as occurred in 1908. The passage of the earth through the tail of Halley's Comet in 1910, for example, did not precipitate any striking sunsets or provoke any magnetic disturbances; its density was less than water or even air. As they near the sun, most comets have an extremely luminous and, as the Greeks described them, "long-haired" appearance; any comet, even a small one, following an orbit that would bring it into collision with the earth would be visible to half the globe long before it touched the atmosphere; the Tunguska object, on the other hand, was sighted only in the final phase of its trajectory before it exploded.</p>

<p>By the end of the 1930s the riddle of the great Siberian explosion was still far from solved. The cause of the blast itself was still uncertain, despite the work of astronomers, geologists, meteorologists, seismologists, and chemists and the resources of the Soviet Academy; and many aspects of the destruction site, such as Kulik's bare "telegraph pole" forest around the Southern Swamp, remained inexplicable. Samples of soil from the fall point had been collected but not fully analyzed. Because Kulik had concentrated primarily on the central region and no expedition had yet explored the entire area of the uprooted trees, the precise borders of the destroyed taiga had not been carefully mapped out or examined. The exact shape of the explosion wave was not yet known, although Krinov had surmised from partial observations that it had an oval form.</p>

<p>In 1938-39 Kulik led his last expedition into the Tunguska region, principally for the purpose "of taking aerial photographs of the destruction. By this time a road had been cleared through the taiga leading 40 miles from Vanavara to a camp site near the Southern Swamp, and a small air strip had been set up near the trading town. On an earlier attempt of Kulik to photograph the area from the air, the plane had crashed into the Stony Tunguska River, but Kulik and the other passengers had escaped unharmed. Although the photos finally obtained on the 1938-39 trip were not entirely satisfactory - they did not cover the whole area and were taken during the summer when the leafage partially hid the uprooted trees - they did verify the radial direction of the smashed forest and confirm the Southern Swamp as the absolute center of the explosion.</p>

<p>For Kulik and the other scientists who still clung to the meteorite explanation, the research of the late 1920s and 1930s led to an impasse. If the Southern Swamp was indeed the blast's epicenter, why were there no traces left of the enormous meteorite's existence? By the beginning of the 1940s Kulik's friend Krinov, in attempting to resolve this contradiction, saw the direction that future researchers must take to unravel the puzzling Siberian event:</p>

<p>Thus the careful investigation of the cauldron as a whole, and of the South Swamp in particular, does not give any grounds for concluding that this cauldron is the place where the meteorite fell. But the absence, anywhere in the immediate or more distant neighborhood of the cauldron, of other areas that might attract attention as the possible places of fall, the Evenki people's designation of the cauldron as the place, the coincidence of the cauldron's co-ordinates with those of the epicentre of the seismic wave, and finally the radial forest devastation around the cauldron - all point convincingly to it as the site of the explosion. There is only one possible explanation that removes the contradiction, i.e., that the meteorite did not explode on the surface of the ground, but in the air at a certain height above the cauldron.</p>

<p>But the intriguing possibility that the blast may have taken place at a high altitude was not immediately investigated. All research on the Tunguska catastrophe was abruptly halted by the advent of a greater holocaust, World War II.</p>

<p>In December of 1938 the Soviet Academy of Sciences had passed resolutions praising "the considerable achievements of Kulik and his group during this period in elaborating a technique for finding the possible point at which the meteorite fell and noting in particular "the great persistence and enthusiasm shown by Kulik personally over many years, in searching for the place where the Tunguska meteorite fell, persistence and enthusiasm that led to the recent concrete advance in our knowledge of the subject."</p>

<p>On July 5, 1941, at the beginning of the Nazi advance into Russia, Kulik joined the Moscow People's Militia, a volunteer home unit composed chiefly of older men like himself with little military training. Despite the Soviet Academy's request that, because of his achievements for the Committee on Meteorites, he be excused from service, Kulik remained in the home guard.</p>

<p>In October, while taking part in a battle on the front line, Kulik was wounded in the leg and captured by the advancing German Army. Imprisoned in a Nazi camp in Spas-Demensk, in the Smolensk district, the fifty-eight-year-old scientist contracted typhus and died on April 24, 1942.</p>

<p>The leading investigator of the Siberian explosion and a pioneer in the development of Soviet meteorite research was buried in the local town cemetery.</p>
