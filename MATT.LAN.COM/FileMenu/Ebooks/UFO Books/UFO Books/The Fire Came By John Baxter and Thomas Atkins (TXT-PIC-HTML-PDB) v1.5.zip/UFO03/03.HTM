<p>The search for an answer to the Tunguska mystery began in what was for Russia a period of total disorder.</p>

<p>In October of 1917, during World War I, revolution had broken out. Shortly afterward, Russia withdrew from the war and the revolutionary government signed a separate peace with Germany. The Western Allies, concerned that Russia might become a German satellite, sent an expeditionary force into northwest Russia. The Japanese landed a force on the Pacific coast of Siberia, and a large group of Czech prisoners of war marched toward Vladivostok in the hopes of eventually reaching their homeland. Many of the Czechs joined forces with Admiral Alexander Kolchak's White Army which was engaged in a bloody war of resistance to the Red Army in central Siberia. For three years much of Siberia was a battleground, littered with corpses.</p>

<p>"Siberia was thrown into anarchy," wrote Emil Lengyel. "Typhus broke out among the refugees; the hospitals could not accommodate them. They stampeded to the towns in the hope of finding relief. In one town of 70,000 inhabitants, struck by the refugee wave, about 200,000 perished. Thousands lay on the streets, at railway stations, along the roads. Hunger followed in the wake of the epidemic. Tens of thousands of monstrously blown-up human forms awaited merciful death in the town of Taiga alone."</p>

<p>Kolchak's men were pitiless in defeat Heaps of bodies marked his passing as he retreated to Irkutsk, which he attempted to make his new capital. The Communist forces were little better. A refugee living near Krasnoyarsk, one of the larger towns in central Siberia, saw in the Yenisei River in winter of 1920 the result of the activities of the Cheka, or Soviet police, charged with wiping out Kolchak's men: "Hundreds of bodies with heads and hands cut off, with mutilated faces and bodies half burned, with broken skulls, floated and mingled with the blocks of ice, looking for their graves; or turning in the furious whirlpools among the jagged blocks, they were ground and torn to pieces into shapeless masses, which the river, nauseated with its task, vomited out upon the islands and projecting sand bars."</p>

<p>Split by civil war and threatened by foreign powers, the Soviet government had little time for scientific inquiry; it was not until 1921, with Kolchak executed, the Japanese and other foreign forces expelled, and order restored, that expeditions once again ventured into the interior of Russia and Siberia.</p>

<p>One of the first trips was mounted by the Academy of Sciences. Before the Trans-Siberian Railway was built the vast distances of Russia had hampered exploration. Now, with the war over and the railway back in operation, most areas of the remote back country were opened up; the Soviet government chose to exploit the situation by sending out not a prospecting or map-making team but one charged with tracking down and locating the many meteorite falls which had been recorded in Russia during and after the war years.</p>

<p>The government's incentive may have been financial. An American group, the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Exploration Company, had begun work at Meteor Crater (also known as Barringer Crater) near Winslow, Arizona, to exploit the largest meteoritic mass known to have hit the earth. Three quarters of a mile in diameter and 570 feet deep, Meteor Crater had intrigued prospectors for decades. In 1903 and 1908 the Standard Iron Company of Philadelphia sank shafts into the crater floor but found nothing. The new company, with a firmer grasp of meteorite ballistics, realized that the object had entered at an angle and drilled near the south rim. </p>

<p>At 1,376 feet the bit jammed, after having brought up oxidized meteoritic iron for 200 feet; as the engineers tried to withdraw the drill, their cable broke, presumably wedged in the dense iron mass. Analyzing samples of the meteoritic material, they found it to be 93 per cent iron and 6.4 per cent nickel; but, more interestingly, mixed with these relatively common metals were traces of precious platinum and iridium which alone might have made the lode worth mining, had the deposit been less deeply buried.</p>

<p>Although the American group failed in its attempts to mine Meteor Crater, news of the operation obviously reached Russia; and the economically reeling Soviet government may have seen its meteorites as a source of quick profit. One of the members of a later expedition to the Siberian site, when the blast was still widely considered to be the result of a meteorite, was quoted as estimating enthusiastically that they might discover a metal mass worth a fortune in the Tunguska region.</p>

<p>The man placed in charge of the Soviet Academy's first special meteorite expedition was a remarkable thirty-eight-year-old scientist named Leonid A. Kulik, who was then doing research at the Mineralogical Museum at Petrograd (formerly St. Petersburg, renamed in 1914). Born in 1883 in Tartu in Estonia, he had studied at the St Petersburg Forestry Institute and in the physics and mathematics department of Kazan University. In 1904 Kulik had served in the Russo-Japanese war, and in 1910 he had been arrested and tried for revolutionary activities. After being imprisoned for a period, he remained under police surveillance until 1912.</p>

<p>While working in the Urals as a forestry officer, Kulik met his scientific mentor V.I. Vernadsky, leader of an expedition searching for mineral deposits, and subsequently became extremely interested in mineralogy. Vernadsky described him as a "lover of minerals and nature" who was "constantly taking pictures." He predicted that Kulik would follow in the footsteps of other great scientific researchers. E.L. Krinov, a noted Soviet scientist and meteorite authority, called Kulik "a vibrant, cultured man around whom young people flocked" and an outspoken individual who was not afraid to voice his opinions when he was convinced he was right. Vernadsky arranged to have Kulik transferred from the Forestry Department to his own expedition; and eventually Kulik and his wife, Lydia Ivanova, went to work for the Mineralogical Museum of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>When World War I broke out in 1914, Kulik was drafted and fought briefly in the Russian Army. He happened to be on a scientific expedition in the Urals and was trapped behind the lines when the civil war erupted. He then went to the Siberian city of Tomsk, where he taught mineralogy. After returning to Petrograd in 1920, he resumed his work at the Mineralogical Museum and devoted much of his time to the acquisition and study of meteorites, a relatively new discipline in which he rapidly established himself as a leading figure. With a single-minded intensity that had characterized all of his earlier work, he studied the literature available about meteorites and attempted to add to the national collection housed at the museum. It was a specialization that soon was to set him, almost by accident, on the track of the Siberian explosion; and yet, at the same time, Kulik's concern with meteorites was to mislead him by encouraging a false conclusion about the nature of the blast.</p>

<p>A "meteorite" in its strictest modem definition refers to any solid, natural extraterrestrial object - usually stone or iron - that strikes the earth. Until a few hundred years ago the word "meteor," from the Greek term meaning "something raised up," was the root used in words describing all phenomena associated with the air, such as lightning, clouds, snow, or rain. The present science of meteorology, or weather conditions, still retains this connotation. During the Renaissance, for instance, man's concept of meteors reflected his picture of himself as existing on a planet located at the center of a fixed universe, in accordance with Ptolemaic cosmology. </p>

<p>In the view of Elizabethan scholars and poets, as S.K. Heninger, Jr., explains, "Meteors were imperfect mixtures of the four Elements. They were confined to the region of the Air in the sublunary universe, since weather conditions could not conceivably transpire in the immutable region beyond the Moon." In Richard II, William Shakespeare made use of the popular belief that the appearance of a meteor was a sign of a disturbance in the elements, a portent of disorder and evil:</p>

<p>The bay-trees in our country are all withered <br>
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; <br>
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth <br>
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change.</p>

<p>Between the middle of the sixteenth century and the middle of the seventeenth, the earth-centered Ptolemaic cosmology had received a death sentence from the startling findings of astronomers like Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler; and consequently men began to look with fresh eyes at the sky. Yet there was still much confusion and ignorance about cosmic phenomena such as meteorites. Aristotle had believed they were fiery exhalations of the atmosphere; later astronomers thought they might somehow be connected with lightning. In the eighteenth century the notion that meteorites were literally "stones from space" was greeted with skepticism, despite the evidence of numerous ancient records as well as current observations to support this fact. This extra-terrestrial theory was at first totally dismissed by the prestigious Academic Francaise, and Thomas Jefferson scoffed at a report stating that stones had fallen from the sky in 1807 onto the soil of Connecticut.</p>

<p>When Leonid Kulik began his study of meteorites a century later, it was clear that we live on what Harvey H. Nininger, of the Colorado Museum of Natural History, was later to call a "stone-pelted planet," bombarded daily by millions of pieces of cosmic debris from asteroids or comets; most of these fragments are so small that they do not survive the superheated plunge through our upper atmosphere and evaporate as bright "shooting stars" or "meteor showers." The identification of the gigantic Meteor Crater in Arizona by geologist Daniel M. Barringer provided concrete proof that in our past the earth had been hit by immense meteorites. Other impact sites have been discovered around the world, including the two-mile-wide New Quebec Crater in Canada and the Vredefort Dome in Transvaal, South Africa, with a width of 26 miles. The largest solid meteoritic mass, approximately 60 tons of iron, was discovered in 1920 in Grootfontein, South-West Africa.</p>

<p>One year later, while preparing for his expedition to locate meteorites which had fallen in the Soviet Union, Kulik received a description of a strange event that aroused his curiosity. Another investigator passed along to Kulik a page from an old St. Petersburg calendar, containing on the back a reprinted Siberian newspaper account of the fall of a meteorite. Kulik had never before heard of this fall, and he read the story with great interest</p>

<p>About 8 A.M., in the middle of June 1908 ... a huge meteorite is said to have fallen in Tomsk several sagenes [a sagene is 7 feet] from the railway line near Filimonovo junction and less than 11 versts [a verst is two thirds of a mile] from Kansk. Its fall was accompanied by a frightful roar and a deafening crash, which was heard more than forty versts away. The passengers of a train approaching the junction at the time were struck by the unusual noise. The driver stopped the train and the passengers poured out to examine the fallen object, but they were unable to study the meteorite closely because it was red hot. Later, when it had cooled, various men from the junction and engineers from the railway examined it, and probably dug round it. According to these people, the meteorite was almost entirely buried in the ground, and only the top of it protruded. It was a stone block, whitish in color, and as much as 6 cubic sagenes in size.</p>

<p>Most of this odd report turned out to be sheer fantasy; only the detail about the train stopping near Kansk was accurate. Yet for Kulik it marked the beginning of an obsession that was to last for the rest of his life. Believing that he might have stumbled on to the discovery of a large meteorite not known to scientists, he began searching through other Siberian newspapers for further stories of the fall. He soon found buried in these papers numerous accounts of a phenomenal event that had occurred in 1908, though the details were often confusing and ambiguous.</p>

<p>A newspaper published in Irkutsk, 550 miles from the explosion, related that on a morning in June of 1908, in a village north of Kirensk, peasants saw "a body shining very brightly (too bright for the naked eye) with a bluish-white light It moved vertically downwards for about ten minutes. The body was in the form of 'a pipe,' i.e., cylindrical." The paper further stated that after the bright object fell, "a huge cloud of black smoke was formed" and a crash as if from "gunfire" was heard. "All the buildings shook," the report went on, "and at the same time a forked tongue of flame broke through the cloud." The villagers had dashed out into the streets in absolute panic; some wept in terror, convinced that this must be the end of the world.</p>

<p>Kulik must have been both elated and somewhat puzzled. Meteorites were usually observed at night, not in the early morning, and the "pipe" shape did not sound like a normal meteoritic object The cloud of black smoke and the flame were also baffling, unless the fall had set the taiga on fire. But this was unlikely at the height of summer when, as every Russian knew, much of the area was an impassable swamp.</p>

<p>Becoming increasingly fascinated and perplexed by each new revelation, Kulik pored through the musty newspapers, now more than twelve years old. An extraordinary story was unfolding in bits and pieces. An enormous "fiery object" had been seen over villages and towns throughout the Yenisei River province; some described it as moving almost horizontally from the south, and almost everybody had felt strong earth tremors and heard loud explosions.</p>

<p>In early July of 1908, for instance, a Tomsk reporter dispatched to Kansk to check out the rumors had stated, "The noise was considerable, but no stones fell. All the details of the fall of a meteorite should be ascribed to the overactive imagination of impressionable people." Yet the reporter qualified his statement by adding, 'There is no doubt that a meteorite fell, probably some distance away, but its huge mass and so on are very doubtful." A week later the Tomsk newspaper, still dubious about the meteorite story, suggested that the event near Kansk had been an earthquake, followed by "a subterranean crash and a roar as from distant firing. Doors, windows, and the lamps before icons were all shaken. Five to seven minutes later a second crash followed, louder than the first, accompanied by a similar roar and followed after a brief interval by yet another crash."</p>

<p>If it had been a meteorite, Kulik was sure that it must have been gigantic - greater than any that had ever fallen before in Russia and perhaps in the world, in order to have caused tremors like an earthquake. But where exactly had it fallen? According to the fragmentary newspaper reports, the phenomena of the fall had been observed over an area extending more than 500 miles. He would need more concrete information before he could pinpoint the exact site of the alleged fall.</p>

<p>One of the most specific and dramatic accounts came from a Krasnoyarsk paper of 1908, which stated that in several villages along the Angara River, in the heart of the taiga, people saw "a heavenly body of fiery appearance cut across the sky from south to north. ... when the flying object touched the horizon a huge flame shot up that cut the sky in two. ... The glow was so strong that it was reflected in rooms whose windows faced north. ... On the island opposite the village horses began to whinny and cows to low and run wildly about. One had the impression that the earth was just about to gape open and everything would be swallowed up in the abyss."</p>

<p>The unexpectedness and magnitude of the event seemed to have created a sense of superstitious dread among frightened villagers throughout central Siberia; after days of absorbing the newspaper reports, which tended to corroborate one another on many basic details, Kulik was not surprised that some Siberians had thought "the abyss" had opened that morning in 1908. What was surprising to him was the fact that this remarkable event had not yet been studied by any scientists - a mistake he intended to remedy on his upcoming expedition.</p>

<p>In a preliminary report outlining what he had learned thus far, Kulik listed the event as the "Filimonovo meteorite," since according to the first story he had read on the back of the calendar page, a train engineer had stopped at the Filimonovo junction after seeing the meteorite. At the station town of Kansk he expected to find witnesses who might clarify what had really happened and help him begin the difficult task of locating the fall point.</p>

<p>For the 1921 expedition, which his friend Vernadsky had persuaded the Academy of Sciences to finance, Kulik was given a railway carriage on the Trans-Siberian Express. He and his researchers left Petrograd in September, traveled across the Urals into Siberia, then made stops in Omsk, Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk, and finally Kansk. It was a long and tedious journey on a railway line still not fully recovered from the effects of war and suffering from a shortage of engineers; as few relief drivers were available then, the "express" would sometimes grind to a stop while the exhausted engineer caught up on his sleep. Kulik was reminded of his earlier trips to the Ural Mountains and to Tomsk which, like most of the stops along the railroad line, was hardly more than a small country settlement with none of the heavy industry that the Soviets were to construct in later decades.</p>

<p>At Kansk, though he quickly found that he was nowhere near the site of the 1908 explosion, Kulik was able to check out the story about the event as experienced along the Trans-Siberian Railway; the station agent had felt a "strong vibration in the air" and heard a loud "rumbling sound," and a locomotive engineer had become so frightened by the ground tremors and noise that he had halted his train, fearing it might be derailed. Investigators had eventually arrived from Tomsk and Irkutsk but had found no sign of a meteorite. As a result of a questionnaire he circulated in Kansk and the surrounding districts, Kulik collected a large number of remarkably vivid personal recollections of the incredible luminous phenomena and the destruction that occurred early in the morning of June 30, 1908. From these eyewitness testimonies, Kulik decided that the fiery object must have impacted farther north, near the basin of the Stony Tunguska River.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that many of the details he acquired conflicted with the traditional signs of such a fall, he was convinced that the object had been a meteorite. Seeking the elusive proof of this became in time a life's work. But for now, he and his team had to return to Petrograd, and the search would have to wait six years.</p>
