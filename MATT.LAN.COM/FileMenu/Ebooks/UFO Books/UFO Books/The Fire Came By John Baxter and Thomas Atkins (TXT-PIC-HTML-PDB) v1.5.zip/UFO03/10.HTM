<p>Is it possible that the flaming "cylindrical" object that exploded in mid-air over central Siberia in 1908 was, in fact, a spacecraft?</p>

<p>As the debate over the multi-megaton blast continued through the sixties and into the seventies, an increasing number of authorities came to the opinion that the answer inevitably must be "yes" - partly because all natural explanations of the "cosmic body" seemed to wither under rigorous analysis but also because, as mankind entered the age of space technology, the idea began to appear more feasible. The belief that the object was artificial, moreover, gained new credence from findings based on the peculiar shape of the explosion and a study of particles found at the blast site, as well as some surprising recent calculations by aerodynamics experts about the flight path through the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The strangely irregular boundaries of the blast region had already been noted by E.L. Krinov during the third Tunguska expedition in 1929. The area of uprooted forest," he observed, "has an oval form with the major axis situated in a direction from southeast toward northwest" The oval shape surprised early researchers, who had expected the area of destruction to be circular. </p>

<p align="center"><i>This 1961 chart, with arrows indicating the direction of the fatten trees, shows the peculiar oval or elliptical shape of the Tunguska blast pattern which puzzled early investigators. The map plots a trajectory approaching from east-southeast (line AB), with the heart of the destruction located in a slightly off-center position in the massive explosion wave.</i></p>

<p>The 1938 aerial photographs further verified this oval pattern; and K.P. Florensky's expeditions in 1958, 1961, and 1962 determined from extensive ground and air surveys that the 1,200 square miles of forest leveled by the explosion and the scattering of "cosmic dust" from the blast had a definite elliptical contour. New maps drawn by Florensky's group showed clearly that the heart of the destruction, the totally scorched region containing the dead but upright trees, lay in a slightly off-center position in an explosive wave that fanned chiefly toward the south and northeast.</p>

<p>What was the significance of the odd elliptical contour of the blast? Discussing this issue, Felix Zigel wrote, "It is very evident on the map of the region that the boundary of the area of complete leveling of the forest is irregular in outline. Also, the epicenter of the explosion and the zone of trees left standing occupy an eccentric position in the region of the catastrophe. Obviously, this asymmetry cannot be explained by the effect of the ballistic wave due to the flight of the body-the zone of destruction is elongated in a direction that is no parallel to the trajectory but at a large angle to it." He there fore characterizes the blast as "directive" - the effect of the explosion was "not the same in all directions."</p>

<p>Following his expeditions in 1959 and 1960, in which he re-examined all of the physical evidence in the Tunguska region, A.V. Zolotov came up with an explanation that Zigel and many other experts found acceptable: the blast had an unusual oval shape because the explosive material was encased in some type of "container." The structure of this container, like the thick paper cylinder of a large firecracker, caused the explosive charge to fan out elliptically as it burst. "The directivity of the explosion," Zigel commented, "was due to the inhomogeneity of the container." The Tunguska object "consisted of at least two parts: a substance capable of nuclear explosion and a non-explosive shell." But is there any concrete proof of such a non explosive container? Some analysts believed that at least partial proof had already been acquired by Kulik - in the soil samples brought back by his expeditions. In the late fifties, when these specimens were subjected to extreme magnification and careful laboratory testing, small particles of extraterrestrial matter were discovered. The Tunguska soil contained concentrations of spherical globules, a few millimeters or less in size, composed primarily of silicate and magnetite, a magnetized iron oxide. The magnetite globules resembled little droplets or bulbs and were sometimes linked together in clusters. Krinov, who took part in the soil study (which had been conducted by A.A. Yavnel), notes that "there are even instances where a magnetite globule ... was discovered in a completely transparent silicate globule." These separate particles appeared to have "coalesced" under tremendous heat, like the trinitite found at the Alamogordo atomic test site.</p>

<p>If the spheres were not of terrestrial origin, were they simply the usual micro-meteorite dust that falls daily across the entire surface of the planet or could they be fragments of the Tunguska object? In 1962 Florensky attempted to resolve these questions. Using a helicopter, his team charted the pattern of the explosion's scattering ellipse over a large area and then collected a wide range of samples for chemical analysis. "At the expedition's base camp in the taiga," he wrote, "we set up a concentration mill, to separate an infinitesimal admixture of extraterrestrial matter from numerous bags of soil samples. Gradually the picture began to take shape, as the outlines of the dispersal pattern became more and more distinct" As they had expected, thousands of "tiny brilliant spheres," many fused together, were found imbedded like pellets in the earth and trees. The pattern of their distribution, moreover, conformed to the elliptical blast wave; the particles appeared to have been dispersed over the Tunguska territory by the "updraft of heated air" from the explosion. </p>

<p>Florensky, still defending the obsolete comet theory, maintained that they were molten cometary debris; but Zolotov and many others were certain that the fused particles could not possibly have come from any known comet or meteoritic body.</p>

<p>This notion was strengthened when more detailed analysis of the spheres revealed small amounts of cobalt and nickel, as well as traces of copper and germanium. Kazantsev and those supporting his views argued that the discovery of these metallic elements offered Further proof of an artificial craft. "Remember that the ship must have had electrical and technical instruments," Kazantsev elaborated, "also copper wires, and surely means of communication - semiconductors containing germanium." The exact source of the strange globules, however, has not been fully determined. It is apparent that the congealed particles resulted from the enormous heat of the explosion; and it is possible to surmise, with a strong degree of probability, that they may indeed be the only existing remnants of the cylindrical object - the "nonexplosive shell" that housed the atomic fire.</p>

<p>Soon Zigel and several other aerodynamics authorities, experienced in modern rocket technology and upper atmospheric trajectories, came forward with some astonishing assertions that ultimately tipped the scales in favor of a spacecraft. When A.Y. Manotskov, an airplane designer, mapped the passage of the Tunguska object through the air, his calculations agreed with Zolotov's findings that the object must have arrived at a velocity much slower than that of a natural cosmic body. Meteorites usually rush into our atmosphere at speeds of between 9 and 13 miles per second, and sometimes as fast as 25 miles per second. Manotskov decided that the 1908 object, on the other hand, had a far slower entry speed and that, nearing the earth, it reduced its speed to "0.7 kilometers per second, or 2,400 kilometers per hour" - less than half a mile per second, which is comparable to the velocity of a high-altitude reconnaissance plane. Boris Liapunov, a Soviet rocket specialist, examined these estimates, and concurred with Manotskov that the object had behaved in its entry and velocity like a supersonic craft.</p>

<p>What flight path did this craft follow through the earth's atmosphere? This has always been one of the most debated aspects of the Tunguska object. The principal clues to its trajectory are the observations of eyewitnesses and the ballistic shock damage caused by the rapid compression of air ahead of the moving object. A high-speed craft, such as a guided missile or supersonic spy plane like the U.S. Air Force's SR-71 which can travel faster than 2,000 miles per hour, gathers before its nose a conical wave of compressed air molecules that causes loud sonic booms when the waves reach the ground and, even at altitudes of several miles, can inflict damage at ground level. The deafening roar heard in June 1908 by witnesses throughout central Siberia during the flight of the Tunguska object was probably caused by its powerful ballistic wave; the series of thunderclaps heard afterwards resulted from the massive blast waves.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/p129.jpg" width="400" height="207"></p>

<p align="center"><i>According to experts, the Tunguska object created a strong ballistic wave during its flight that was exactly like the shock wove of a missile. This Soviet chart depicts (1) the trajectory of the object (seen from overhead); (2) the ballistic wave at the instant of the explosion; (3) the ballistic wave after the explosion, and the angle of the tree fall from the blast's epicenter.</i></p>

<p>Most investigators have agreed that determining the flight trajectory was essential to uncovering the object's true identity. After studying the damage of the ballistic shock and the explosion itself, various investigating teams from the late 1920s to the present have arrived at very different conclusions about the flight path.</p>

<p>Three of the first interpreters of the Tunguska event, Voznesensky, Suslov, and Astapovich, basing their opinions primarily on eyewitness reports and seismic data, decided that the object moved from south-southwest to north-northeast Kulik, after examining the blast effect around the Southern Swamp, believed that "the meteorite flew in the general direction from south to north," while Krinov proposed that "the trajectory ran from southeast to northwest" and placed the "projected position on to the earth's surface of the beginning of the trajectory as corresponding approximately to the northern shore of Lake Baikal."</p>

<p>Later, Florensky's findings convinced him that 'both the general pattern of the toppled trees and the relationship between the centers of fallen deadwood and the searing effects - as well as the distribution of cosmic dust - indicate that the object came from east-southeast" According to another scientist, V.G. Konenkin, east-southeast to west-northwest was the most probable trajectory. In his field investigations, Zolotov examined standing trees that bore traces both of the ballistic and blast shock; he concluded that the air wave, which caused relatively minor damage compared to the explosion, had definitely come from the southwest.</p>

<p>Did the object arrive from the southeast or the southwest? At first the problem appeared impossible to resolve, for eyewitness testimony and forest damage could be produced to support either direction. The object had been visible overhead as a "fiery body" to villages near Kansk, southwest of the blast, but it had also been seen in Kirensk and other towns lying to the southeast. Scores of separate, reliable observations made both flight paths seem equally feasible, though obviously the same object could not have appeared almost simultaneously in two different locations hundreds of miles apart.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/p131.jpg" width="550" height="453"></p>

<p align="center"><i>The fight path of the cosmic object, as reconstructed from eyewitness testimony and ballistic wave evidence. Felix Zigel and other space experts agree that, prior to exploding, the object changed from an eastward to a westward direction over the Stony Tunguska region. The arc at the bottom of the map indicates the scope of the area where witnesses either saw the fiery object or heard the blast.</i></p>

<p>Or could it? The problem of the different trajectories was eventually solved with a startling answer: both paths were accurate. The object had switched direction in its journey over Siberia!</p>

<p>The information acquired by the Florensky and Zolotov expeditions about the ballistic shock effect on the trees provides a strong basis, in some scientists' view, for a reconstruction of an alteration in the object's line of flight. In the terminal phase of its descent, according to the most recent speculations, the object appears to have approached on an eastward course, then changed course westward over the region before exploding. The ballistic wave evidence, in fact, indicates that some type of flight correction was performed in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The same opinion was reached by Felix Zigel, who as an aerodynamics professor at the Moscow Institute of Aviation has been involved in the training of many Soviet cosmonauts. His latest study of all the eyewitness and physical data convinced him that "before the blast the Tunguska body described in the atmosphere a tremendous arc of about 375 miles in extent (in azimuth)" - that is, it "carried out a maneuver." No natural object is capable of such a feat. Thus Zigel, together with Soviet rocket and aviation experts such as Manotskov and Liapunov, joined Kazantsev in believing that the remarkable cylindrical object causing an elliptically-shaped atomic blast in 1908 could only have been "an artificial flying craft from some other planet."</p>

<p>In addition to its maneuvers near the earth's surface, the craft must have steered, as it approached from outer space, into a trajectory angle almost identical to the re-entry path used by modern space vehicles. To make a successful entry through the dense air blanket surrounding our planet, a spacecraft must maintain a precise flight angle of minus 6.2 degrees to the horizon. American astronaut Michael Collins has described the difficulty of navigating back into the earth's atmosphere: "The allowable limits were spectacularly small. On the return trip, the atmospheric 're-entry corridor,' or zone of survivability ... was only forty miles thick, and hitting a forty-mile target from 230,000 miles is like trying to split a human hair with a razor blade thrown from a distance of twenty feet." Missing this corridor can be fatal, for if the angle is too steep, the craft will burn up in the severe frictional heat; if too shallow, it will rebound back into space. In order to penetrate to the lower layers of the earth's atmosphere, the craft of 1908 must have executed the hazardous trip through the entry corridor with near perfection.</p>

<p>According to the Soviet astronomer B.Y. Levin, who made a careful study of the Tunguska object's movement through the atmosphere, the estimated height at which it was first sighted was approximately 80 miles. Witnesses saw a fiery tube "shining very brightly with a bluish-white light." The entry zone at the edge of the atmosphere is encountered at this same altitude; passing through this upper air layer, any sizable object, such as a spacecraft, acquires a luminous plasma coating that causes it to glow like a meteor with a brilliant white-hot radiance.</p>

<p>There is strong evidence, therefore, to indicate that an extraterrestrial vehicle may explain the Siberian explosion. Though the proof is not complete and cannot be viewed as absolutely conclusive, the discoveries of modem astrophysics and astronomy, particularly recent insights regarding the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe, are providing a new perspective in which this theory appears increasingly acceptable and logical.</p>
