<p align="center"><i>Leonid Kulik (1883 1942) discovered the impact site of the great explosion of 1908 near the Stony (Podkamennaya) Tunguska River in central Siberia and spent much of his life trying unsuccessfully to prove that it had been caused by a meteorite.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl02.jpg" width="303" height="400"></p>

<p align="center"><i>Ilya Potapovich, who witnessed the frightening effects of the Siberian explosion and later served as a guide for Kulik on his first expedition.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl03.jpg" width="400" height="279"></p>

<p align="center"><i>In 1927, from the Khladni Ridge, Kulik had his first long range view of the devastated forest In the distance the areas where the taiga has been flattened and stripped of foliage stand out as white patches of snow Younger pines have sprouted throughout the dead forest.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl04.jpg" width="400" height="270"></p>

<p align="center"><i>The partially destroyed Tunguska forest seen by Kulik in 1927 as his expedition approached the fall point Trees on the hill in the background have been
leveled, their roots pointing northwards towards the blast.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl05.jpg" width="400" height="284"></p>

<p align="center"><i>An example of the variety of devastation Trees in a small valley have been stripped of branches but remain standing, while others on a slope have been knocked down In the foreground is a totally uprooted tree.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl06.jpg" width="400" height="259"></p>

<p align="center"><i>The area of peat bog known as the Southern Swamp, which Kulik called the 'Great Cauldron' The explosion took place in the air, approximately two to three miles directly above this point In the foreground is the puzzling 'telegraph pole' forest, seared and stripped of branches yet still standing.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl07.jpg" width="400" height="232"></p>

<p align="center"><i>Kulik set up the winter quarters of his 1929 expedition on a hillside near the southern swamp. New growth in the foreground already rivals in size the older trees which perished in the blast.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl08.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>

<p align="center"><i>The famous Meteor Crater at Canyon Diablo, in the Arizona desert near Winslow, was caused by the impact of a gigantic meteorite during prehistoric times. The crater is three quarters of a mile wide and 570 feet deep. Though Kulik believed that the Siberian explosion may have resulted from a similar huge meteorite, no crater was ever found in the Tunguska region.</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>The flash of an atomic fireball as observed from the air only microseconds after the detonation of a test bomb over Bikini Lagoon on 1 July 1946. Eyewitnesses noted a similar blinding burst of light that 'split the sky in two' over the Tunguska region on the morning of the 1908 explosion.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl10.jpg" width="281" height="400"></p>

<p align="center"><i>A brilliant ionization glow surrounds the cooling fireball of the Diablo test at Yucca Flat, Nevada in 1957. After the Tunguska explosion ionization caused massive 'silvery clouds' and lurid sunsets over a period of several days.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl11.jpg" width="242" height="400"></p>

<p align="center"><i>Ground zero directly below the explosion of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima The trees still standing around the Japanese Agricultural Exposition Hall bear a strong resemblance to the scorched but upright trees directly below the centre of the Siberian explosion.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl12.jpg" width="400" height="217"></p>

<p align="center"><i>The destruction of Hiroshima was caused by a single uranium 235 bomb Soviet writer Aleksander Kazantsev was the first observer to comment on the extraordinary similarity between the patterns of destruction in the Japanese city and the charred, flattened Tunguska forest.</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>A photograph of the surface of Mars from an altitude of 1,225 miles Locked in an ice age, Mars has no water and is dotted with huge volcanoes and craters This enormous valley, about 330 miles south of the equator, has branching canyons extending into plateaus Kazantsev conjectured that the Martian landscape was similar to the frozen, Arctic tundra stretching just above the Siberian taiga, and that the Martians may have come to earth to search for water.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl14.jpg" width="400" height="339"></p>

<p align="center"><i>Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, not far from the Stony Tunguska region Over a mile deep in places and containing over one thousand species of plant and animal life found nowhere else on Earth, Lake Baikal has an eerie reputation locally, is it possible that an extraterrestrial craft was headed for the lake when it crashed?</i></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pic/pl15.jpg" width="400" height="382"></p>

<p align="center"><i>This 1963 photograph shows a portion of the Tunguska region as it appeared fifty five years after the blast, with new trees growing amid the dead, broken trunks and debris Later expeditions found from examination of tree height and growth rings, that after 1908 the growth rate in surviving trees as well as in trees which germinated after the explosion was markedly accelerated.</i></p>
