<p>Almost as if Leonid Kulik's tragic death had been a signal, speculation on the cause of the Tunguska explosion took a new and unexpected turn after World War II.</p>

<p>As a scientist, Kulik had been chiefly an observer and collector rather than an experimenter; he had been more inclined to accumulate and catalogue the wonders of the natural world than to inquire into their nature. With the help of a network of largely amateur collectors, who recorded new meteorite falls, Kulik had increased and meticulously catalogued the National Collection of Meteorites; and in his years of research he had done as much as one man could to illuminate the Tunguska mystery. But the new generation of scientists had a different view and, more important, a vastly more sophisticated technology to apply to the problem. </p>

<p>Their development accelerated by the war, communications in particular had become infinitely easier, with the result that a technologist in the Soviet Union could read of the latest theories in world science and apply them to his own field. At international conferences and on research trips, scientists of all nations observed at first hand the work of foreign colleagues and visited sites that would indirectly have a profound effect on their own work. Without such visiting between experts and pooling of research, the Tunguska riddle may have remained unsolved forever. But, in fact, the late forties brought about a revived interest in the explosion and a radical change in the theories advanced to explain the event.</p>

<p>Except among hard-line adherents to Kulik's theory, the word "meteorite" was seldom heard; most scientists preferred to call the Tunguska object a "cosmic body" and to describe the fall simply as an "event," a "phenomenon," or, more popularly, a "catastrophe." Every such reference suggested the new trend of speculation on "what had caused the cataclysm of 1908.</p>

<p>One man was in no doubt over the cause of the blast. His theories, carefully presented over the postwar years and backed up with his considerable prestige as an author and technician, were fundamentally to change the whole structure of the argument.</p>

<p>If one could have set a computer to choose a person to carry on Kulik's task in solving the Tunguska riddle, it is unlikely that anyone better could have been found than Aleksander Kazantsev. He had actually been born in Siberia - at Akmolinsk in 1906 - and had studied at Tomsk and Omsk, cities in which speculation about the Tunguska event had a long history. Graduating from the Tomsk Technological Institute in 1930, Kazantsev, like Kulik, went to the Urals where he became head mechanic of the Beloretsky Metallurgical Plant.</p>

<p>Kazantsev's vivid imagination and technical skill quickly brought him to the attention of the Soviet authorities, and during the 1930s he was promoted to a post in one of Moscow's scientific research institutes where, among other tasks, he assisted in preparing Russia's exhibit for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Kazantsev joined the Army when Russia was invaded in 1941 but, too valuable to be wasted in the infantry, was soon appointed head engineer of a defense complex, where he worked on the development of new weapons.</p>

<p>For his efforts he later received the Order of the Red Star and other honors.</p>

<p>Not content with his career as a technologist, Kazantsev had, long before the war, mastered chess and became an important writer on the game. In 1936 he had also exhibited another side to his multifaceted talent by entering a national competition for science-fiction film scenarios. His Arenida took first prize but, when it was not made into a film, he reworked it as a novel, The Burning Island, which was highly successful in the Soviet Union. After the war, he became a full-time author.</p>

<p>Like most Siberians, Kazantsev was fascinated by the bleak landscape of arctic Russia. To him, however, it represented something more than a mere frontier. He grasped the alien nature of the tundra; Mars, he felt, must look very like this frozen, wind-swept waste. Throughout his arctic travels of the mid-forties - journeys on the survey ship Georgiz Sedov which were to serve as the basis for a series of arctic stories and fantasies - the image of northern Siberia as that part of the earth's surface most like another planet became stronger in his mind. It was to be a central concept in the evolving controversy over the Tunguska explosion.</p>

<p>The other impetus for new speculation on the blast came from a location less geographically remote than Mars.</p>

<p>In August 1945, when the American atomic bomb burst 1,800 feet above Hiroshima, the world had its first demonstration of the havoc a nuclear blast could inflict on a city. Kazantsev was among the Russian scientists who evaluated the Hiroshima data and visited the city some time after the blast. For him, the journey through its desolation had the eerie quality of a dream dimly remembered: he saw sights that were strangely familiar, phenomena that he had encountered before. Hiroshima in many respects resembled photographs he had seen of the blasted area on the Stony Tunguska where an explosion had occurred in 1908.</p>

<p>The Japanese explosion,' made up almost entirely of flash and concussion, agreed in many ways with the damage done to the Siberian taiga in 1908 and the evidence of the eyewitnesses. At Hiroshima, only a few hundred yards from the blast center, was a group of trees, charred and stripped of their leaves but still standing upright, like those on the Stony Tunguska. Elsewhere, houses had been flattened just as the giant Siberian larches were toppled. The mushroom cloud, the black rain which fell after the blast - all were similar to what had been seen in Siberia. Every new investigation, including the detection of signs of radiation on the site, supported his theory; no meteorite or comet had caused the 1908 blast. What had exploded there was atomic.</p>

<p>An atom bomb in 1908? The idea at first made little sense. But to Kazantsev, with his fascination with Mars, there was only one credible explanation. An alien space ship, traveling from Mars, had chosen Siberia as a location for its landing or, more likely, plunged there out of control before exploding in the air. Why had the Martians come to earth? Kazantsev believed they came in search of water for their dying planet, and he conjectured that they may have originally been headed for Lake Baikal, the earth's largest body of fresh water.</p>

<p>Shrewdly, Kazantsev chose a popular magazine to publish his thesis. In America science fiction has long been accepted as a legitimate form for the presentation of scientific theories, though few scientists took advantage of its opportunities for free speculation. In Russia the tradition was stronger, and the technically oriented Soviet society of the postwar years encouraged the growth of many magazines which, like early American
SF periodicals such as Electrical Experimenter, mixed science fiction with science fact. In 1946 Kazantsev used one of these publications, Vokrug Sveta (Around the World), to put forward his theory that the devastation on the Tunguska was caused by a nuclear space ship from another world exploding high over the taiga.</p>

<p>In a later article, he interpreted graphically the effect of such a blast:</p>

<p>The explosion wave rushed downward, and the trees directly below the point of the explosion remained standing, having lost only their crowns and branches. The wave burned the points of those breaks on the trees and hit the permafrost, splitting it. Underground waters, responding to the tremendous pressure of the blow, gushed up as those fountains seen by natives after the explosion. But where the explosion wave struck at an angle, trees were felled in a fan-like pattern.</p>

<p>At the moment of the explosion, the temperature rose to tens of millions of degrees. Elements, even those not involved in the explosion directly, were vaporized and, in part, carried into the upper strata of the atmosphere where, continuing their radioactive disintegration, they caused that luminescent air. In part these fell to the ground as precipitation, with radioactive effects.</p>

<p>From another author, such a speculation would have been greeted with derision, but when presented by the distinguished Kazantsev, with his honored war record and background as a technologist, it commanded respect Always careful to offer it only as an interesting hypothesis in the form of popular science or as science fiction, Kazantsev developed his theory for the next ten years, finally presenting it in 1958 in its most elaborate form in the story-article "A Guest from the Cosmos," which was published in Yunyi Tekhnik (Young Technician), the monthly of the Communist Youth League. Later it became the central piece of his 1963 book of the same name.</p>

<p>"A Guest from the Cosmos" was set in a locale that, for Kazantsev, was familiar: the cabin of an arctic survey ship carrying a group of scientists into northern Siberia. This time, however, their purpose is to find a spot in the Arctic that approximates to the climate of Mars and establish whether life can exist there. One of the scientists, Krymov, claims to know with certainty that there are Martians and that they have visited earth. Having been bom a Tungus in the area of the Stony Tunguska, he was a boy when the great explosion of 1908 occurred. The event had far-reaching effects both on him and his family.</p>

<p>"My father went into the fallen taiga," Krymov explains, "and saw a huge column of water flowing out of the ground. A few days later he died in terrible pain as if he was on fire. But there was no trace of fire anywhere on his body. The old people of the tribe became terribly afraid. They forbade all of the Evenki [Tungus] people to go into the area of the fallen trees. They called it a cursed place. The shaman said that it was there that the god of fire and thunder, Ogdy, descended to the earth. All who go to that place are burned with an unseen fire."</p>

<p>Pressed to give his interpretation of the death, Krymov adds, "In the legend about the god Ogdy who burns with an unseen fire - what could this fire be that leaves no traces on the body? It could be nothing other than radioactivity, which begins to appear at a certain time after an atomic explosion." To Krymov, only one explanation - that the object was a burning spaceship plunging out of control through the earth's atmosphere - could explain what they knew of the Tunguska catastrophe. "Apparently the travelers died en route from cosmic rays or from meteorite bombardment," he states. "As the uncontrolled ship approached the earth, it resembled a meteorite because it flew into the atmosphere without reducing its speed. The ship burned up from friction just as a meteorite would burn. Its outer shield was burned off, and its atomic fuel experienced conditions that made possible a chain reaction. Then an atomic explosion occurred and our cosmic guests died on the very day they were supposed to descend to earth."</p>

<p>Though some dismissed the idea, many members of Soviet scientific circles carefully studied Kazantsev's theories. Writing in Znaniye-Sila (Knowledge Is Strength) in June 1959, Professor Felix Zigel, who taught aerodynamics at the Moscow Institute of Aviation, remarked that "at the present time, like it or not, A.N. Kazantsev's hypothesis is the only realistic one insofar as it explains the absence of a meteorite crater and the explosion of a cosmic body in the air." As for Kazantsev's standing as a fiction writer, Zigel said, "It is generally known that at times - nay, often - new ideas that proved to be most valuable to science were first expressed not by scientists, but by writers of scientific fantasy." Within the Soviet Union Kazantsev's work remained highly respected and the subject of furious debate. In 1954 he was admitted to the Communist party, a considerable distinction for an author. As for his worth as a scientist, he wrote in June of 1957 an article called "Observation of Radio Signals from an Artificial Satellite and their Scientific Value" for Radio, the journal of the Soviet Ministry of Communications. The article foreshadowed the launching of a Soviet satellite and even revealed the radio frequency on which it would broadcast. Four months later, Sputnik 1 was launched.</p>

<p>As the Tunguska controversy raged on, a gradual polarization became apparent. One group, under hard-line meteorite experts like Krinov and K.P. Florensky, refused to admit that anything except a conventional meteorite could have wreaked the havoc in Siberia in 1908; even such well-publicized reversals of position as that of V. Fesenkov, who announced in October 1960 that he no longer believed in the meteorite theory, could not shake the conviction of this group. Fesenkov, A. Shternfeld, and a growing body of ingenious, often younger technologists agreed with Kazantsev that the blast had been atomic, while on the question of the power source they were, if not prepared absolutely to accept Kazantsev's idea, willing at least to keep an open mind. The postwar scientific establishment had seen enough of the atomic age and considered enough of the new theories to know that today's impossibility was tomorrow's reality. Applying the newest techniques of cosmology, atomic physics, and chemistry to the available data, they set out to seek a final explanation of the mystery of 1908.</p>
