<p>Let us take as a starting assumption the possibility that the same beings who were instrumental in bringing about the Mosaic Old Testament tradition, and who also met with Old Testament prophets, were also the efficient cause behind the New Testament religion. The question then immediately arises, Who was Jesus Christ? Our temporary answer will be that, as the Christmas carol 'O Come, All Ye Faithful' suggests, Christ was 'born the King of Angels' (cf. Hebrews 1:4). Rather than begin with the chronological sequence of events related to the New Testament faith, let us begin by examining one of the most obvious links between Christ and the Old Testament 'pillar of cloud and of fire.'</p>

<p><b>The Bright Cloud And The Transfiguration Of Christ</b></p>

<p>The New Testament Gospels report that a short time before Christ was to be crucified, Jesus, Peter, James and John went up to a high mountain apart from the other disciples, Jesus 'was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and Ms garments became white as light. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. And Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is well that we are here; if you wish, I will make three booths here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah." He was still speaking, when lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him." When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Rise, and have no fear." And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only' (Matthew 17:1-8).</p>

<p>The Church has always wondered about the significance of the Transfiguration passages in the New Testament. If one assumes that the early Christians deliberately sought to deceive people into thinking that Jesus was the chosen one, then one might expect the disciples to 'manufacture' a story such as this to make an apparent link between Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. Thus, as in any case involving the reporting of news events, we are at the mercy of the reporter or witnesses. The Transfiguration was witnessed by fewer people than saw the Red Sea incident, but there were enough people there to remember the important aspects of the event in some detail. What we shall find throughout the New Testament is that the spectacular events such as the Transfiguration and the Resurrection are not performed in public view. Unlike the UFO leading Israel through the Red Sea, or the demonstration at Mount Sinai, or the showering of 'bread from heaven,' power in the New Testament is always undercover. While there is an underlying suggestion of power throughout the whole New Testament, the power is played down, and we shall discuss the significance of this fact more completely when we mention the 'temptations' of Jesus.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the Transfiguration story is an essentially valid reporting of news as we have found it in Matthew's Gospel. It is consistent exegetically and logically to believe that the 'bright cloud' which overshadowed the disciples and Jesus was the same type of UFO which led Israel out of Egypt and through the wilderness - exegetically because of the parallel between the description of the bright cloud and the pillar of cloud and fire and because of the reported presence of Moses and Elijah; logically because how many beings from how many other worlds would be likely to come to earth in UFOs to set up a religion among the Jews? A voice came from the UFO, just as Moses heard a voice coming from the middle of the 'thicket' which (due to the presence of the UFO in its midst) appeared to be on fire; Moses was in constant vocal contact with a being in the UFO throughout the wilderness journey. Elijah heard a voice coming to him from outside a cave, and probably the same type of UFO was present in each case.</p>

<p>The fact that Moses and Elijah were supposedly present at the Transfiguration obviously points to the unity between the Old and the New Testaments, as does the presence of the UFO. Whether or not Jesus was associated with - indeed sent by - the God of the Old Testament is of course the most important question which could confront any Jew - and the disciples were Jews. If we find the description of the Transfiguration hard to believe, then it must be even harder to believe that Moses and Elijah were present. They had been dead for hundreds of years (except, of course, that Elijah never died on earth - he was reportedly taken away in a UFO). Besides, how could the disciples know that they had seen Moses and Elijah? My only answer to this question is that Jesus told the disciples that they had seen Moses and Elijah. (The 'introductions' that must have been involved stagger the imagination. Try to imagine Jesus saying, 'Peter, James, and John, I would like you to meet Moses and Elijah.')</p>

<p>The only way we can accept the Transfiguration sequence is to accept not only a belief in angels, an assumption on which this book is based, but also the Biblical idea of the 'resurrection of the body.' The New Testament does not believe simply in the salvation of a man's 'soul,' but preaches the resurrection of the body - based on the bodily Resurrection of Christ. The New Testament maintains that there is an angel world and that these angels, at least some of them, are special servants of God, sent to help plant the seed of the Hebrew-Christian religion in the soil of the earth - in the minds of men. The New Testament suggests that all men who accept the salvation offered in Christ will someday be raised from the dead as Christ was raised. After Christ was raised from the dead, he 'ascended into heaven'; that is, he returned to the angel world from which he had come. We too, so argues the New Testament, at some point in time after we die will be taken to the angel world or the resurrection world to be with Christ (exactly when this will happen is a bit of a problem).</p>

<p>The ideas of the resurrection of the body and of angels are intimately related. I doubt that a person can believe strongly in one and not in the other. The Apostle Paul was on trial before the Jews, and he brought up the subject of the resurrection of the body to divide the Pharisees and the Sadducees because, as Luke notes in the book of Acts, 'the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge them all' (Acts</p>

<p>23:8). Roughly speaking, one might say that Bishop Robinson and the 'demythologizers' are arguing like Sadducees, and I am arguing like a Pharisee - I am suggesting belief in another world, a resurrection world, a world of angels.</p>

<p>Jesus himself sided with the position of the Pharisees against the Sadducees on the question of the resurrection. While on many other occasions Jesus condemned the Pharisees for their religious snobbery, he did support their resurrection theology. On one occasion the Sadducees gave Jesus a hypothetical situation in which a man died, having no children, and by custom his younger brother married the widow. There were seven brothers, and each in turn married the widow and died, leaving her to the next brother.</p>

<p>The question was then directed to Jesus, 'In the resurrection, therefore, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her' (Matthew 22:28).</p>

<p>Jesus gave two answers to this query. First he said, 'You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven' (Matthew 22:29, 30)- Jesus takes the idea of the resurrection for granted; he knows both the Scriptures and the power of God, and both testify to the resurrection. His comment that in the resurrection men become like angels illustrates why it is nearly impossible to believe in the Biblical idea of bodily resurrection and not to believe in angels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;How do the Scriptures testify to the resurrection? Jesus continued, 'And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?" He is not God of the dead, but of the living' (Matthew 22:31-32). To the astonishment of everyone, Jesus had suggested that even now Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were alive. On one occasion Jesus said, 'Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day; he saw it and was glad' (John 8:56). Jesus seems to be consciously aware of another world - a world of angels, and of persons who long ago died on earth but now five in a resurrection world. In this context we must evaluate the suggestion in the Transfiguration story that Moses and Elijah were present. What about angels and the resurrection? At this point we can only ask the question.</p>

<p>The Transfiguration story also suggests that Jesus was transfigured; that is, that his face seemed to glow and his garments became luminescent. Again there is a connection between Moses' experience with his UFO, for we read in Exodus that when Moses came down from Mount Sinai after conversing with the being in the UFO, 'the skin of his face" shone' (Exodus 34:29). Peter's response suggesting that three 'booths' be made seems to imply that a holy place of worship should be set up - like the Tent of Meeting in which Moses served, with the UFO hovering over it night and day.</p>

<p>In the face of this experience, especially when the UFO (bright cloud) appeared, the disciples fell on their faces, perhaps out of fear, or to shield their eyes from the bright light. Then Jesus touched them and told them to get up and not be afraid. I am sorry that the disciples buried their faces, for I suspect that they would have reported seeing Moses and Elijah enter this UFO which had recently arrived and depart by means of it. As it is, the Bible says only that when the disciples again had the courage to look, they saw Jesus alone. Moses, Elijah, and the bright cloud had disappeared.</p>

<p>What was the purpose of this meeting at the Mount of Transfiguration? Matthew's Gospel goes on to say that 'as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Tell no one the vision, until the Son of man is raised from the dead'" (Matthew 17:9). Luke's version of the Transfiguration suggests that Moses and Elijah spoke to Jesus 'of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem' (Luke 9:31). As we shall soon see, angels seemed to have played an important role in the Resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p>What is the significance of the Transfiguration from a philosophical point of view? The Petrine literature attributes the following words to the Apostle Peter, who is reflecting on the significance of the Transfiguration: 'For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For when he received honor and Glory from God the Father and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased," we heard this voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain' (II Peter 1:16-18). </p>

<p>The term Majestic Glory is a unique reference to the 'bright cloud' type of UFO which was reported to have been present at the Transfiguration. But what we wish to point out is that it seems quite clear that the early Church considered the Transfiguration to have been a historical event, and Peter, James, and John were eyewitnesses to this event, including the presence of the UFO. Most of the 'honest to God' and 'death of God' theologians would argue that the UFO reported to have been present at the Transfiguration was mythological. But the above passage in II Peter stresses that the disciples 'did not follow cleverly devised myths' in presenting their version of the gospel; rather, what they preached was an eyewitness account of the events which surrounded Christ.</p>

<p>Many modern theologians argue that when the Biblical people reported contact with beings from another world, this report must be interpreted as mythological in nature. But it is quite clear that in the mind of the early Church the Transfiguration passage, including the presence of the UFO, which is recorded in the Gospels (written earlier than II Peter), is not a myth, but an eyewitness account. The early Church seemed to claim to know the difference between fancy and fact as surely as do Bultmann, Robinson, or Altizer. </p>

<p>Is the early Church to be trusted in regard to this claim? Is the Transfiguration report essentially mythological or scientific in nature? Throughout both the Old and New Testaments there is a constant warning against idolatry. There is an awareness that men are always tempted to create a wooden God with their own hands, or a mythological God with their own minds. But the Bible claims that the God who shows himself to the Biblical people is not one they have made with their own hands or minds - through beings from another world God has acted on the Biblical people. If the 'pillar of cloud' in the Old Testament or the 'bright cloud' at the Transfiguration is mythological, then it would seem that the Biblical people are guilty of idolatry, according to their own standards of judgment.</p>

<p><b>The 'Glory' Of The Lord And The Birth Of Christ</b></p>

<p>There are various aspects connected with the birth of Christ which have tempted scholars to point to mythological origins of the traditional accounts of this event, but the idea of beings from another world operating in UFOs with the specific intention of bringing attention to the birth of Christ can certainly explain the Biblical account. What is clear in Luke's account is that the birth of John the Baptist and the birth of Jesus were both preceded by angelic visitations - Mary being visited by the angel Gabriel (Luke 1:26), who told her that she would not conceive in the usual manner, but rather by the Holy Spirit. The Bible suggests that Mary was 'greatly troubled' (Luke 1:29) by Gabriel's visit, which one can well imagine.</p>

<p>When Christ was born in Bethlehem, angels appeared to shepherds during the night to announce Christ's birth. 'And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear' (Luke 2:9). We saw in the book of Exodus that the pillar of cloud and of fire produced the idea of the 'glory' of God, and the UFO which led Moses was called the 'angel of God.' It is not clear in this passage in Luke whether the shepherds actually saw angelic persons or whether they simply saw a glowing object over their heads and heard voices coming from it. Whatever the case, this sequence in relation to the shepherds is consistent with the UFO activity in relation to Moses during the Exodus and also with the UFO which we met at the Transfiguration. Matthew records that 'wise men from the East' followed what they thought was a star to the place of Christ's birth. </p>

<p>These men were undoubtedly interested in astrology, and perhaps they were following a star. The Bible says, however, that the Wise Men followed the star 'till it came to rest over the place where the child was' (Matthew 2:9). But stars do not move in this manner, nor do they move and then suddenly stop. The Air Force is forever explaining to people that when they think they have seen a UFO, they have in fact seen a star or a planet; perhaps the Wise Men were involved in a reverse experience. (The Air Force would probably argue that the Wise Men were wise - and they knew a star when they saw one). In any case, if beings from another world deliberately sought to draw attention to the birth of Christ, a space vehicle answering the description of modern UFOs would have been capable of carrying out the activities which the Bible describes: transporting beings from another world to instruct shepherds, lead Wise Men with some type of star-like beacon, or even bring Gabriel to meet Mary.</p>

<p><b>The Spirit 'Descending' Like A Dove -The Baptism Of Jesus</b></p>

<p>Luke suggests that very early in his life Jesus was conscious of who he was; at the age of twelve he was arguing with Jewish teachers in the Temple (Luke 2:41-51). The Gospel of John reports that Mary, the mother of Jesus, knew that he had unusual powers and apparently encouraged him to do something about the lack of wine at a marriage feast. Although Jesus pointed out, 'My hour has not yet come' (John 2:4), he nevertheless proceeded to change water into wine. Mark implies that the hour of Jesus did 'come' when Jesus was baptized in the Jordan by John. All four Gospels refer to the baptism of Jesus, and scholars agree that the four Gospel accounts of Jesus' baptism share a common tradition. Although none of the Gospel writers (except perhaps John) seems to have been a witness of the baptism, each concluded that the baptism was such a crucial event in the life of Christ that each has included the baptism in his narrative.</p>

<p>Jesus came to John the Baptist, who had been preaching repentance from sin and baptizing in the Jordan as a sign of God's cleansing. John was hesitant to baptize Jesus, but finally consented. 'And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him; and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil' (Matthew 3:16-4:1).</p>

<p>After Jesus was baptized, some sort of UFO apparently entered the situation for some reason. What did the UFO look like, and what was its mission? The question as to the physical shape of the UFO has been the cause of controversy in the field of Biblical scholarship. C.K. Barrett, in his work The Holy Spirit and the Gospel Tradition, points to all the difficulties in saying that the UFO had the physical shape of a 'dove' or pigeon, (1) which of course has been the assumption of the Church throughout the ages. Artists, when they wish to symbolize the Holy Spirit, have invariably painted a picture of a white dove in flight. </p>

<p>Matthew, Mark, and John say in effect that Christ saw the Spirit 'descending like a dove.' The fourth Gospel says that John the Baptist 'saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him' (John 1:32). This is important, for the Biblical witness as a whole suggests that the 'Spirit' was some concrete reality which anyone who happened to be present at the baptism might have seen. Luke underlines the concreteness of the Spirit by saying that it descended in 'bodily' form (Luke 3:22). The UFO which descended was more than an 'inner vision.'</p>

<p>The difficulty is that Luke, in trying to stress that the Spirit in this instance was a concrete visible reality (which in Biblical thinking it usually is not), said that 'the Holy Spirit descended upon him [Jesus] in bodily form, as a dove' (Luke 3:22). Here Luke seems to imply that the Spirit had the bodily shape of a dove. Nowhere else in the Scriptures - neither in the Old nor in the New Testament -is there any clear reference to the Spirit of God's looking like a dove. Before dealing with the problem of Luke's reading, it is important to remember that Luke did not say that a dove descended on Jesus; Luke said that the Spirit descended on Jesus, and the Spirit took a bodily shape which was 'like' a dove. Stress the idea of likeness; a dove did not descend on Jesus - something like a dove did.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties with the 'dove' concept is that the Luke reading has been made normative for the Matthew, Mark, and John readings. The latter say that the Spirit was 'descending like a dove.' They do not say that the Spirit physically looked like a dove - they are referring to the similarity between the way in which a dove descends in flight, wings spread and motionless, and the way in which the Spirit appears when it descends. Apparently there is nothing visibly in motion when the Spirit is seen to descend, except the motion of the whole 'Spirit body,' whatever that may be; the Spirit is also by implication nearly silent in its descent.</p>

<p>Matthew was trying to convince Jewish readers of his Gospel that Jesus was the new Moses. Therefore, any way in which Matthew could point to a link between Jesus and Moses was to Matthew's advantage. Baptism was a sign that man had been set free from sin, just as the Hebrews had been set free from slavery in Egypt. The great event which separated the Hebrews from slavery was the parting of the Red Sea; thereafter the Jews were free from Egypt. When the River Jordan stood in a 'heap' for Joshua, the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land. For the Hebrews, crossing a body of water set them free from their sinful past and set them toward a new future. But also after the sea the Hebrews were led by the pillar of cloud and fire into the wilderness for a time of testing, and the Israelites did not stand up to the test very well - they cried for food and water, and Moses used his powers (through the UFO) to supply the needs of the people. Immediately after Jesus was baptized, Matthew tells us that 'Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil' (Matthew 4:1). </p>

<p>Among other things Jesus was tempted to turn stones to bread to satisfy his hunger. Matthew suggests that Jesus was in the wilderness forty days and forty nights, as the Hebrews were in the wilderness forty years. As Moses was led into the wilderness by the pillar of cloud, so Jesus was led into the wilderness by the 'Spirit.' If Matthew in trying to say that Jesus was the new Moses were to suggest that whereas Moses was led into the wilderness by 'the cloud,' Jesus was led into the wilderness by a pigeon or 'dove' this would almost amount to saying that Jesus was a false prophet, for the dove would be a false sign. There is no Old Testament precedent for saying that the Spirit looked like a dove. If Matthew tried to convince the Jews that Jesus was led into the wilderness by a dove rather than by the 'cloud,' he would be defeating his own purpose.</p>

<p>The second alternative is to look for ways in which the idea of the 'cloud' became an equivalent of the 'Spirit of God' for the Old Testament writers and for subsequent New Testament thought. When Elijah was taken up into heaven by the 'chariot of fire,' some of the prophets went to the hills to search for Elijah, for, they said, 'it may be that the Spirit of the Lord has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain' (II Kings 2:16), because this seems to have happened to Elijah frequently. By the time Elijah was Israel's prophet, the idea of the 'cloud' had been transformed into the concept of 'the Spirit of the Lord.' In the book of Numbers we read that seventy elders were in a sense 'baptized' with the spirit of prophecy: Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the spirit that was upon him [Moses] and put it upon the seventy elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied' (Numbers 11:25). Thus with Moses and Elijah there is evidence that the 'reality' with which prophets had contact - the pillar of cloud and fire - came to be associated with the 'Spirit of God.'</p>

<p>John the Baptist pointed out that the baptism in which Jesus would be involved would be twofold, of water and of spirit or fire. John had baptized with water only. Throughout the New Testament there is a strong emphasis on the need for a twofold baptism, of water and Spirit, and Jesus, speaking to Nicodemus, pointed to the need to be 'born of water and the Spirit' (John 3:5). Jesus suggested that this need was so basic to Judaism that Nicodemus, a Jewish teacher, should have realized what Jesus spoke about. In John's Gospel Jesus spoke of 'Spirit' as like the wind, which is, of course, more traditional. But the pillar of cloud and fire was also apparently a symbol of baptism by the Spirit. The Apostle Paul on one occasion said, 'I want you to know, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea' (I Corinthians 10:1, 2). </p>

<p>We have here a passage which points clearly to the relation between the baptism of not only Jesus but of all Christians, and the incident at the Red Sea. Even at the Red Sea the baptism was of water and Spirit, although the Israelites did not even get their feet wet! When John the Baptist said that Jesus would baptize with fire, he undoubtedly had in mind the pillar of fire, so that when John saw the Spirit descend on Jesus, he should have expected to see the pillar of cloud and of fire descend on Jesus. This may very well be what John saw.</p>

<p>When the Spirit descended, a voice from heaven said, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased' (Matthew 3:17). We have already seen at the Transfiguration that a 'bright cloud overshadowed' the disciples, and a voice came from the cloud saying, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him' (Matthew 17:5). If both the baptism and the Transfiguration are events which have been described with some accuracy, then it would seem likely that the voice which came from the UFO on each occasion came from the same class or type of UFO, and that would be the 'bright cloud' or pillar of cloud and of fire variety. The baptism was of course witnessed by an entirely different group of people from those present at the Transfiguration, with the exception of Jesus, so we might expect the description of the UFO to be somewhat different.</p>

<p>If it was the 'cloud' which led Moses through the wilderness, which was also at the Transfiguration, and which was also present at the baptism, then the only conclusion we can come to is that when we read that the Spirit was 'descending like a dove,' the Bible means that 'the pillar of cloud and of fire was descending like a dove,' or simply that Jesus saw 'the cloud descending like a dove.' We then have to ask, Is there any Biblical precedent for comparing the flight of a cloud and a dove? The sixtieth chapter of Isaiah begins by saying that 'the glory of the Lord has risen upon you' (Isaiah 60:1) and goes on to promise that the nations of the world will be drawn to the 'light' and 'brightness' hovering over Israel. The 'pillar of fire' was of course the origin of the idea of the glory and brightness of the God of Israel. This passage of promises closes by asking the question,</p>

<p align="center"><i>Who are these that fly like a cloud,<br>
and like doves to their windows?</i></p>

<p>(Isaiah 60:8).</p>

<p>In the context of this passage, which is certainly difficult, the author seems to have in mind the whole Mosaic tradition which refers to the bright cloudlike UFO which saved Israel from Egypt in the past, and will in the future draw all nations to it. If these 'clouds' carry the angels of God, then in the tradition of Hebrew parallelism, in which the idea of the first line is carried over and stressed in the second line, we have here a comparison between the way in which clouds and doves fly, and doves of course often 'descend' from above to a window below. </p>

<p>We do have here a clear Biblical precedent for comparing the way in which clouds and doves fly, and the link may be between the flight of doves and the glorious cloud, or the Spirit of the Lord. Thus for Matthew to say that the Spirit of God was descending as a dove descends has Biblical precedent, providing that we keep in mind that by the 'Spirit' Matthew means the 'bright cloud' of Biblical tradition. It is important to notice here that the comparison is not between the way a cloud and dove appear in physical shape, but between the way they fly.</p>

<p>One fact which is not clear from the baptism accounts is exactly what happened to Jesus as the UFO descended. Matthew says, 'And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water' (Matthew 3:16). The picture which Matthew portrays is that Jesus was baptized, and as soon as he was baptized, Jesus went running out onto the bank of the Jordan. Or, as Matthew says, 'he went up immediately from the water.' Why should Matthew stress that Jesus went up 'immediately'? If Matthew does not say that Jesus ran to the shore, he does clearly suggest that no time was wasted in getting to the bank.</p>

<p>While the RSV says that Jesus 'went up' from the water, the actual Greek word says that Jesus 'ascended' from the water, and the Greek word immediately suggests the notion of 'uprightness'; Matthew almost seems to be saying that Jesus ascended uprightly or vertically from the water. Was Jesus drawn vertically from the water into the UFO, which at this time was descending from above? Matthew then goes on to say that Jesus 'was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness' (Matthew 4:1). What does Matthew mean by 'led up'? One might suppose that Jesus would have been led' like Moses, but if we remember that Elijah was 'caught up' by the Spirit on occasions, then we cannot be sure. Some scholars have suggested that Jesus was 'snatched away' after his baptism as later the Apostle Paul was apparently 'caught up' into heaven. (2)</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Mark says 'And when he [Jesus] came up out of the water, immediately he saw ... the Spirit descending upon him like a dove' (Mark 1:10), so that Mark places the idea of 'immediacy' with the descent of the dove, rather than with Jesus' coming out of the water. But Mark does say that the Spirit 'drove' Jesus into the wilderness, which implies something more violent than simply 'leading.' John's Gospel reports that John the Baptist saw the Spirit 'descend and remain' on Jesus. This suggests that Jesus and the Spirit merged, and furthermore that John did not see them separate from each other. It certainly would not be out of line for a UFO of the type we have seen in the Old and the New Testaments to have come upon Jesus at his baptism and to have carried him bodily into the wilderness. This would certainly make an impression on anyone who saw it happen, and would help explain why the baptism is recorded in each of the four Gospels. Whether or not the UFO carried Jesus into the wilderness, it seems quite certain that the 'pillar of cloud' type of UFO was seen to 'descend like a dove.'</p>

<p>In John's Gospel, shortly after the baptism sequence, Jesus called Nathanael to be a disciple, and Jesus told Nathanael that he would 'see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man' (John 1:51). Matthew records that after Jesus had met his temptations in the wilderness, 'the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him' (Matthew 4:11). This would appear to be information which Jesus himself would have had to give to the disciples, but it is important to note the suggestion that Jesus was in frequent contact with beings from another world. One of the questions which is often asked is: How did Jesus come to understand his own mission to the world? If we suppose that a pillar of cloud type of UFO descended on Jesus at his baptism and that this UFO either led or carried Jesus into the wilderness, then we can suppose Chat it was during this period that Jesus formulated his mission, just as Moses made contact with the 'angel of God' on Mount Sinai in order to understand his mission.</p>

<p>Having examined the baptism account in some detail, I shall now refer to the problem we noted earlier, that Luke said the Spirit descended on Jesus 'in bodily form, as a dove' (Luke 3:22). First, one should notice that Luke alone says 'in bodily form,' so that it is probably Luke, rather than Matthew, Mark, or John, who stands outside the correct tradition. It is important to remember that Luke was the only Greek author of the New Testament, and perhaps he did not completely understand the 'pillar of cloud' tradition behind the account of the baptism which he heard. As Luke's account was passed on to the Greek world, immediately artists started painting 'doves' as a sign of the Spirit, something a good Jew would never do.</p>

<p>Keep in mind also that Luke says the Spirit was in bodily form 'as' or 'like' a dove. Luke does not say a dove descended, but rather something like a dove. If we can imagine a white circular cloudlike UFO 100 feet in diameter descending from above, perhaps a white dove with its wings spread in a nearly circular arc does portray some similarity to what the Biblical witnesses saw, and a similarity to a modern, descending flying saucer. It is not too difficult for one's imagination to compare the way a white dove descends, silently with its wings spread, and the way in which modern UFOs described by Keyhoe, Edwards, and Vallee usually move about.</p>

<p>Matthew was seeking to portray Jesus as the new Moses, and in this context the temptations of Jesus make interesting reading. If there was a UFO of the pillar of cloud type which led the Israelites through the Red Sea, then this represented nothing short of a sensational demonstration of power. Moses also arranged through the UFO to have bread rain from heaven, and water came from rocks at the touch of Moses' rod. The first temptation which faced a hungry Jesus was, 'If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread' (Matthew 4:3). </p>

<p>Again, Jesus was tempted to leap from the 'pinnacle of the temple,' knowing that the angels of God would save him in the sight of everyone, thus proclaiming that he was the savior (Matthew 4:5, 6). (The temptation to leap from the temple, together with the report that Jesus walked on water [Matthew 14:25], suggests that Jesus, together with the 'angels,' or the beings in charge of the Red Sea incident, may have had unusual control over the forces of gravity.) Jesus was always tempted to use his power to draw attention to himself - if he is the savior, it is important that people notice him. But it is clear from the incidents of Moses with the rebellious Israelites in the wilderness that a display of power alone does not permanently convert people. But Jesus seems to have had power, and when necessary he used it. Thus when he met the sick, he healed them. When five thousand became hungry, he fed them. Although he did not seem too pleased about it, for the sake of his mother he changed water to wine.</p>

<p>Men followed Jesus after he had fed a great multitude with 'five barley loaves and two fish' (John 6:9), and Jesus withdrew because the men 'were about to come and take him by force to make him king' (John 6:15). When asked why he had run away, Jesus appeared despondent because men sought him not for what he taught, but because you ate your fill of the loaves' (John 6:26). Jesus then went on to explain that he was the eternal bread from heaven. 'Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven' (John 6:49-51).</p>

<p>The Jews were not too impressed with this description which Jesus had offered 
concerning himself. They said, &quot;Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose 
father and mother we know? How does he now say, 'I have come down from 
heaven'?&quot;' (John 6:42). I cannot help thinking here that Jesus is portrayed in 
the Bible in much the same way as our modem-day 'spy' stories. Jesus came from a 
foreign world into our world and started to gather together a small band of 
people who would owe their allegiance to his world (heaven). Jesus is really an 
'undercover agent.' An 'undercover' agent is a person who lives in a foreign 
country, or enters a foreign country, undercover, under a cover story, living 
under an assumed name, perhaps working as a carpenter, or a tourist agent, or an 
engineer - anything which will serve to cover up his true purpose, which is 
espionage, undermining the nation in which he is 'undercover' for the sake of 
another nation. </p>

<p>According to Jesus, our world really belonged to the 'devil'; Jesus defeated 
the world of the devil, first of all by refusing to turn in his heavenly 
citizenship and coming over completely to this world (the temptations), and 
secondly, by gathering together a strong following of persons who were committed 
to citizenship in the eternal kingdom from which Jesus came.</p>

<p>Jesus came into our world under a perfect 'cover' story: By means of the virgin birth Jesus was able to come from another world, but could appear to have come naturally, to be a 'natural-born citizen' of this world. Obviously the cover story was very believable. When Jesus actually told the Jews that he was a 'foreign spy' from heaven, they did not believe him. They said, 'We know your parents, we know where you live, you have spent your whole life in this neighbourhood - you must be joking to tell us you are a foreigner, from heaven.' </p>

<p>In fact, the cover story under which Jesus came into our world was so effective that even up to the present day people are debating the question, Did Jesus come from heaven? Our country - indeed, the world - has since been literally divided in its loyalty, some arguing that Jesus was a man and nothing more; others, that his true citizenship was in heaven. Those who attempt to demythologize the New Testament seem to be trying to take away Jesus' heavenly citizenship. The debate is as old as Christ - and the battle is not yet over. The temptations suggest that Jesus could have used his power to put the question beyond doubt, but that he did not want his power to distract from his 'words' or teachings.</p>

<p>Thus the baptism of Jesus, in which he made contact with beings from another world in some sort of UFO, followed by the temptations, illustrates vividly the tensions in Jesus' ministry between using the power he held over nature, and desiring men to come to him and listen to what he had to say: 'Love your neighbour, and love the Lord your God, love one another as I have loved you.' Some have tried to argue that Jesus was so conscious of the need to 'underplay' his power that he would never perform a 'miracle,' and that therefore all the accounts of miracles in the New Testament are false. It appears, however, that Jesus performed his miracles not to draw attention to himself, but rather because he found a need which he could not pass by 'on the other side,' as did those who saw a wounded man who had fallen among thieves. </p>

<p>What we shall see is that the UFO which led Moses never made a powerful display before a New Testament crowd as had been done at the Red Sea; but the UFO in the New Testament does appear to small groups. There seems to be in the New Testament an undercurrent of power. The angels of God, God's army, could overpower the world by force, but they have chosen rather to send in an undercover agent to undermine our trust in our 'worldly' government. It is not surprising that the disciples had trouble convincing the Jews that the Christ had really come. The Jews, thoroughly fed on Mosaic tradition, expected to be knocked flat by the power of Christ when he came.</p>

<p><b>The Space Cloud And The Ascension Of Christ</b></p>

<p>After Christ had carried out a ministry of at least three years, he entered Jerusalem on what has been called Palm Sunday, and the following Friday was crucified. We then read in Matthew, 'Now after the sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the sepulchre. And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead ..."' (Matthew 28:1-7). </p>

<p>All four Gospels suggest that there were unusual persons - beings from another world - present at the empty tomb on Easter morning to explain to the individuals who came to the tomb what had happened. We have seen that at the Transfiguration Jesus was making plans concerning the Crucifixion-Resurrection event with persons from another world (Moses and Elijah) who seemed to have arrived by means of a 'bright cloud' type of UFO. There was an 'earthquake' associated with the arrival of the angels at the tomb, which could indicate the presence of a UFO which might by its anti-G beam cause a disturbance similar to the one reported at Mount Sinai and the one reported by Elijah outside the cave in which he was hiding. It is important to notice that the angel at the tomb is not recorded to have had wings - in fact, Biblical angels (with the exception of the cherubim and seraphim) almost never seem to have wings. If they did have wings, this would certainly be mentioned. It is only later that Christian artists, trying to discover a logical explanation of how angels could move around in space, provided these beings from another world with wings.</p>

<p>What distinguished the angel at the empty tomb was his 'brightness,' a property exhibited by the body of Jesus at the Transfiguration. The angel was different from ordinary men not because he had wings, but because 'his raiment' was 'white as snow.' He wore unusual clothing, perhaps much as our astronauts seem always to wear white clothing to reflect certain types of radiation. It is important, however, that Jesus does not seem to have carried out the Resurrection all by himself. Whether or not the angels at the tomb were actually the instruments or agents who brought Jesus back from the dead I do not know, but it is a possibility which must be considered.</p>

<p>Jesus made several appearances after his Resurrection, and on one occasion he appeared to at least five hundred people at one time (I Corinthians 15:6). After Jesus had made a series of Resurrection contacts over a period of time - tradition suggests forty days (Acts 1:3), something like a month perhaps - he had one final meeting with his disciples at the Mount of Olives just outside Jerusalem (Acts 1:12).</p>

<p>It is this last meeting between Jesus and his disciples which concludes with his Ascension. 'So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth." And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven"' (Acts 1:6-11).</p>

<p>Notice that the disciples were convinced that ultimately Christ would be King of the earth, and that he would be in a position to 'restore the kingdom to Israel,' the kingdom once held by David. Jesus does not deny that someday the kingdom will be restored - he simply tells the disciples that it is not for them to know when. The disciples believed that Christ had the power to 'take over' the earth any time. The only question was, When?</p>

<p>Jesus commissioned his small band to be missionaries throughout the whole earth. The Gospel of John stresses the fact that Jesus thought he had been sent as a missionary-savior (or if you prefer, undercover agent) by his heavenly Father. In a prayer Jesus said, 'As thou didst send me into the world, so I have sent them [the disciples] into the world' (John 17:18). The best single sentence summary of the Biblical mentality is in a short parable of Jesus: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leaven' (Matthew 13:33). The Old Testament religion seems to have been started by beings from another world coming into the situation and 'hiding' a religion among a small chosen band of primitive nomadic people - hardly a place one would look for true salvation. When Jesus came, he was born of Mary, disguised as a carpenter's son. His small band of disciples, however, saw his power, including the shocking experience of his Resurrection from the dead, and after that experience the disciples never questioned the Lordship of Jesus. </p>

<p>Once again the leaven had been hidden in the loaf - among an unlikely small group of men. The 'demythologizers' suggest that the Resurrection was a mythological construction of the disciples, but I find it much more scientific in terms of modern psychology to suggest that the Resurrection was such a factual event for the disciples that this event convinced them it would be worth their while to die for Christ - which Peter was not willing to do before the Crucifixion. The disciples did not expect to meet Jesus three days after he was dead any more than we would expect to meet a friend three days after the funeral. Jesus said to the disciples, in effect, to go into the world as we angels have come into your world; the Father has sent me; I send you; be the leaven in the world loaf.</p>

<p>After Jesus had commissioned his disciples to begin working like leaven in the world loaf, 'as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.' At this point it is difficult to be surprised that a 'cloud' took Jesus up out of sight of the disciples. While Matthew reported that a 'bright cloud' appeared at the Transfiguration, both Mark (Mark 9:7) and Luke (Luke 9:34) report simply that a 'cloud' overshadowed the disciples. Thus if Matthew rather than Luke had written Acts, we might have read in Acts that a 'bright cloud' took Jesus from the sight of the disciples. In any case the distinction is not important, for even as far back as the book of Exodus the 'pillar of cloud and fire' had been shortened to 'the cloud" (Exodus 14:20).</p>

<p>Bishop Robinson in Honest to God on the very first page of his first chapter leads with his ace. 'Even such an educated man of the world as St Luke can express the conviction of Christ's ascension - the conviction that he is not merely alive but reigns in the might and right of God - in the crudest terms of being "lifted up" into heaven.' (3) The ordinary person of today might look at the passage in Acts to see what Bishop Robinson was talking about, and reading that Jesus was taken away in a 'cloud,' and that the rest of the passage seems to be quite literal - everyone standing around watching - would be tempted to take the word cloud literally; everyone knows that nice white fluffy cumulus clouds do not carry people about. Any person thus taking a quick glance at the Bible would conclude, 'Bishop Robinson is absolutely right! </p>

<p>That Ascension language certainly is "crude."' But this cloud was no ordinary cloud. This UFO seems to have been capable of carrying Jesus off into space - I am tempted to call it a 'space cloud' - but I very much suspect that the Ascension cloud was the same UFO which led the Israelites through the Red Sea, gave Moses the commandments, carried Elijah to heaven, 'descended' like a dove at the baptism of Jesus, perhaps carrying him bodily into the wilderness, as he was carried away bodily at the Ascension. This was probably the same 'cloud' which brought two men to meet Jesus at the Mount of Transfiguration, and probably the same type of UFO which brought angels to the shepherds at Christmas. What Robinson has not told his readers is that the Ascension story is not abnormal - it is normal for the Biblical way of thinking.</p>

<p><b>The Bright Light And The Conversion Of The Apostle Paul</b></p>

<p>One of the key turning points in the history of the Church was the conversion of the Apostle Paul. Paul, then Saul, had studied theology under the brilliant Jewish teacher Gamaliel. Paul was so zealous in his support of the Jewish faith that he became in a sense a 'missionary' against the Christians, their chief persecutor. Paul was apparently present at the stoning of Stephen (Acts 8:1), and he was so successful as a 'chief persecutor' in Jerusalem that he was commissioned to go to Damascus to carry his talents to a new field. </p>

<p>When Paul was converted, it was this same militant spirit which made him such an effective Christian missionary - he was willing to travel anywhere and do anything for the gospel. Not only did Paul become the greatest missionary the Church has ever had, but he is also the greatest theologian the Church has had - his training in Jewish theology made him a perfect choice to work out the implications of the Christian faith in light of the Old Testament foundation. Paul's letters form the basis of New Testament theology, together with the Gospels and the book of Acts. One can very well ask: Where would the Church be today if it had not been for the Apostle Paul? If Adolph Hitler had suddenly during World War II turned from Nazi Germany to become an Allied General, everyone would have been greatly shocked. It was equally a shock to the Church when Paul was converted - at first no one could believe it, and many distrusted him - as we would undoubtedly have been suspicious if Hitler had suddenly been converted to the Allied cause.</p>

<p>How was Paul converted? Here is one account in the book of Acts. 'But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do." The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one' (Acts 9:1-7).</p>

<p>The conversion of Paul is recorded in two other passages in the book of Acts, and these passages do not repeat exactly what is said in the above passage. The first passage says that the men traveling with Paul heard the voice but saw no one. The second passage says, in quoting Paul, 'Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me' (Acts 22:9). On the third occasion Paul was defending himself before King Agrippa, and he said, 'At midday, 0 king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining round me and those who journeyed with me. And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"' (Acts 26:13,14). </p>

<p>Thus Acts 9:7 says specifically that the men with Paul heard the voice; Acts 22:9 says that the men did not hear the voice, but that they definitely saw a bright light; Acts 26:13,14 states that all were affected by the light and fell to the ground, and does not tell us one way or the other who besides Paul heard the voice. However one goes about reconciling the passages, the overall impression is that the men who were with Paul were stunned by the bright light, although not blinded as Paul seems to have been (Acts 22:11). The men with Paul seem also to have felt the brunt of the experience because remarks to this effect are reported in each instance; this is a good indication that Paul did not experience a purely emotional or subjective conversion. </p>

<p>It seems most consistent with the other Biblical material to assume that the same type of 'bright cloud' space vehicle which had led the Israelites through the Red Sea (and had spoken to Moses out of the middle of a glowing thicket to call him), and which spoke to Elijah outside of the cave (Elijah covered his face because of the brightness; the bushes shielded the eyes of Moses), the UFO which was the source of the voice at the Transfiguration which said, This is my beloved Son,' and which undoubtedly was the vehicle in which Christ was taken away at the Ascension, was also the UFO which hovered over Paul and his companions on the Damascus Road, and as this 'bright cloud' hovered overhead, Jesus called to Saul. 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' Saul was so shocked that he asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The voice answered, 'I am Jesus.' It seems consistent to argue that if Jesus 'ascended' in some sort of UFO, the same vehicle brought him to Paul's company on the Damascus Road.</p>

<p>There is no evidence for a purely 'subjective' interpretation of Paul's conversion. There were psychological factors involved, of course, but to use psychology as the only category of interpretation is not only untrue to the Biblical text, but an unconvincing answer to the very pressing question: What on earth (or in heaven) could have happened to cause a Jew of Paul's convictions to change suddenly and become a Christian - a leader of those he had persecuted? The UFO thesis we have outlined is a sufficient scientific explanation providing that UFOs exist, and such an explanation is consistent with the Biblical material as a whole. </p>

<p>It is probably a psychological shock for most Christians to think of Paul's conversion in the way I have suggested, but Protestant Christians have usually made only one requirement for the orthodoxy of their theology; that is, that it be Biblical. The UFO theory I have outlined is certainly consistent in explaining the Biblical data. Edgar J. Goodspeed has given Paul's conversion an essentially 'subjective' interpretation, and I will here quote Good-speed to illustrate the contrast between my UFO interpretation and ah essentially psychological approach:</p>

<p>As he drew near the city, his anguish of spirit increased. Was this then really the will of God, persecution and cruelty, baptized with the holy name of religion? Must he go on implementing it against humble, earnest people whose humility and heroism rebuked his arrogance and pride? Who was this Jesus, against whom he must so bitterly crusade in the name of God? It was midday and his figure rose before the mind of Saul, reproachful and sublime. And suddenly Saul saw him in a new light, not an impostor and upstart to be condemned and persecuted but a master and leader who could deliver him from all his confusion and pain. It burst upon him with all the suddenness of a revelation, turning his world over and restoring his moral values to their rightful place. It challenged him with the clearness of an audible voice: 'Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?' Why, why indeed was he persecuting Jesus? He should be following him. (4)</p>

<p>Goodspeed has no doubt found a way to 'explain' the conversion of Paul in terms which will not be offensive to twentieth-century scientific thinking. While Goodspeed undoubtedly has an understanding of some of the psychological elements involved, one cannot help feeling, if the name of Jesus were pressing so hard on the mind of Saul as he approached Damascus, that when he heard the 'almost' audible voice calling his name, it was hardly appropriate for Saul to answer the voice with the question, 'Who are you, Lord?' The other unfortunate aspect of Goodspeed's account is that it gives one the impression that Paul so to speak converted himself by pulling himself up by the bootstraps of his own conscience. </p>

<p>Paul writes to Timothy that God was merciful to him (Paul), appointing him an Apostle for Jesus Christ 'though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and insulted him; but I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief (1 Timothy 1:13). Paul finds that he is a good sign of hope for the Church; he is the chief of sinners - if he can be saved, anyone can be saved. Paul certainly believed that if God had not acted in a special way on the Damascus Road, he would have continued to persecute the Christians 'in ignorance and unbelief.'</p>

<p><b>Summary Of The New Testament And Flying Saucers</b></p>

<p>We have pointed to five main 'events' in the New Testament which certainly suggest the presence of a UFO which is sometimes described as a 'bright cloud,' recalling the UFO which had such close contact with Moses. There is one aspect of each of these five events which has gone almost unnoticed. The bright 'glory' which shone around the shepherds at night, while the angels sang, was seen by only a few men who would hardly be called the leaders of Jewish society. The event took place out in the country away from a populated area. </p>

<p>The baptism of Christ took place out in the wilderness by the Jordan River, and very few people were likely to see the UFO descend like a dove. Only Jesus, Peter, James, and John seem to have been present to witness the 'bright cloud' at the Mount of Transfiguration, a mountain which again was away from a population center. Jesus was taken away from the disciples at the Ascension by a space 'cloud' which was seen only by the disciples. They were apparently at the Mount of Olives at the time, outside Jerusalem. Finally, the UFO which caused the bright light to flash over the Apostle Paul and his small band of travelers on the road to Damascus was again seen in a place which was not likely to attract the attention of a city population. How unlike the 'pillar of cloud and fire' which was constantly before the Hebrew people, demonstrating its power at the Red Sea. Thus in contrast to the Old Testament, while the same 'beings from another world' or 'forces' or 'UFOs' seem to be at work in the New Testament, we never find the fantastic display of power in the New Testament that we found in the Old Testament, in front of thousands of witnesses. When power is shown, those who witness it become the 'leaven' in the world loaf.</p>

<p>Although a scientific and theological study of the relation between flying saucers and the Bible could go into greater depths of scholarship and scientific and philosophical background than we have gone, we have examined enough of the Biblical material to show that it is quite likely - if flying saucers exist - that beings from another world in some sort of UFOs deliberately caused the Biblical religion. We have not proved that this is the case, but it seems quite likely - it has a fair degree of probability. The difficulty is that a host of questions remain unanswered. To give an example of two pressing questions: (1) What was the motive of the beings who started the Biblical religion ? Did they do it just for fun, or are they under the command of the God and Lord of the Universe? (2) Where do these beings come from? If they are beings from another planet 'playing games' with us, where do they come from? If they are angels from God, where is heaven?</p>

<p>The difficulty with each of these questions is that if we have drawn the conclusion that beings in UFOs were active in developing the Biblical religion on the basis of less than conclusive evidence, then if we are to form any answers at all to the two questions just raised, it is quite clear that from a scientific point of view such answers must be considered pure speculation. At this point science and religion begin to diverge even more.</p>

<p>In regard to the first question, suppose that the man of science and the man of faith could agree that the Biblical religion was deliberately caused by beings from another world who are now watching our 'progress.' Each man may raise the question: Are these beings simply playing games, or are they under the command of God? G. Ingle-field and Jacques Vallee agree that a series of UFO appearances in Fatima, Portugal, in 1917 in connection with the Virgin Mary are apparently related to the Christian faith, and they ask this same basic question. (5) Was the event a 'miracle,' or a large interplanetary 'hoax'? The man of science can express his opinion, 'It seems more probable to me that ...' or he may prefer to say, 'I cannot decide without further evidence.' It is perfectly legitimate in the field of science to sit on the fence until more evidence is available, provided that the scientist pursues the question faithfully in each direction. But the man of faith must decide now. </p>

<p>It seems quite clear that the Biblical people were called upon to commit themselves to Christ on the basis of the evidence they had - incomplete or otherwise. Many accepted Christ on the evidence of one miracle. Scientists might argue that one miracle does not compel one to conclude that the miracle worker was a savior. But the man of faith must decide, because the whole course of his life depends on his decision. In science a man may be compelled to find a cure for cancer because time lost is life lost. The Bible argues in effect that time lost in deciding the answer to the question 'Who do you say that I am' is life lost. So we must ask, Was Christ sincere, was he on the level in claiming to be the Son of God - was he telling the truth? On the basis of the witness of the Gospels, which is about all the evidence we have, we have to ask: Would Jesus pretend to pray to his heavenly Father; would he preach 'love' while living a lie; would he even go so far as to be crucified to carry out his 'hoax'? At this point the person rather than the works of Christ becomes focal.</p>

<p>The second question - where do these 'angels' come from, a planet, or from heaven? (the two might be identical) - presents similar problems. There is little evidence for the pure scientist, but the man of faith who decides that beings in UFOs are from heaven must ask, on the basis of the Biblical witness, Where is heaven? Before describing the whereabouts of heaven, we would like to visit it. At present this presents problems; nevertheless, notice that scientists have gained much information about the moon without visiting it. They have used instruments as 'media-no</p>

<p>tors' between earth and the moon. By using telescopes and cameras mounted on telescopes, and by sending rockets to the moon which have televised photographs to earth, scientists have given us much knowledge of the moon. All Christians have is the Bible, which is nevertheless for the Christian in many cases a record of things said by beings from another world about their world. Jesus often spoke about the other 'world' from which he had come. Thus the Bible, with its record of the words of Jesus, the angels, prophets, and apostles, becomes a 'mediator' between us and heaven; the Bible is our telescope through which we look for heaven. Just as our astronauts may someday bring back to earth information about another world, so Jesus and the angels may provide us with information about their world. However unsatisfactory a record or instrument the Bible may be to some scientists, at the present time it is what the man of faith has available to him. </p>

<p>A scientist who wishes he had more evidence nevertheless does use what evidence he has. When we move into eschatology, we move into the twilight zone of the Christian faith. But Christians have always wondered in their dreams, Where is heaven?</p>
