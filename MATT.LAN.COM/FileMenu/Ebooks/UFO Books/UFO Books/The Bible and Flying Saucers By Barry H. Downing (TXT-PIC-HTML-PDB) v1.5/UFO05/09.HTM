<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p>

<p>1. I do not mean to suggest that I am the first writer to consider the possible relation between flying saucers and the Bible. Frank Edwards, in his book Flying Saucers - Serious Business (New York, Lyle Stuart, 1966), makes reference to a possible relation between UFOs and the Bible, and mentions a book by Morris Jessup entitled The UFO and the Bible (pp. 16 ff, in Edwards's book). Although I have not been able to obtain a copy of the book by Jessup, it is clear that others have thought about the subject. But it is also clear that the relation between the Bible and flying saucers is not being discussed by the professional theological community, as I believe it should be.</p>

<p>2. For a brief discussion of some of the issues involved in the 'death of God' theology, see Time magazine's cover story, 'Is God Dead?' April 8, 1966, pp. 82-87. In this book we shall refer mainly to the work of Thomas J.J. Altizer of Emory University, one of the leaders of the death of God theology.</p>

<p>6. I wrote to the Department of the Air Force, Project Blue Book, and received in return what seemed to be an undated leaflet entitled 'Project Blue Book,' and the enclosed letter described this as 'The current report on Project Blue Book.' I am not certain when the report was written. I received the report in early 1966, and the only date on the report was 'Jan 65.' The quoted statement is found on page 4 of the report I received.</p>

<p>8. On February 1, 1966, I sent a letter by registered mail to the Project Blue Book Information Office, SAFOI, Washington, D.C., 20330, U.S.A., containing some of the suggestions discussed here concerning any possible relation between relativity theory, curvature of space, and UFOs, but I received no reply to my letter. Since the administrators of Project Blue Book do not admit having any 'firm evidence' of the existence of UFOs, it would, of course, be difficult for them to reply to a letter based on the assumption that they do exist.</p>
