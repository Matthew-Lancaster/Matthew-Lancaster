<p><b>Some Observations On Exodus</b></p>

<p>The early Genesis material goes back several thousand years B.C., and Hebrew history which officially begins with Abraham may go as far back as 2000 B.C. There is no use pretending that Abraham (assuming that one admits he was a historical figure) held the same world view as a twentieth-century suburban American. There is no doubt that something like a 'mythological' world view was shared by many ancient cults, and the Hebrew people mixed with this mythology, whether in Egypt or among the pagan tribes of Palestine. Our social sciences are built on the assumption that man is conditioned by his environment. and we can hardly expect that the Hebrews were unaffected by the cultures with which they were forced to mix. But one thing that is clear about the Hebrew is the fact that they did not mix very well with the rest of society, and many of the orthodox still prefer not to mix even up to the present day. The other fact is that one cannot make any strict rules about the religious environment which 'conditioned' the Hebrew faith. </p>

<p>The Bible suggests that the real environmental stimulus behind the Hebrew faith was a God who made himself known through agents from another world. Furthermore, the main evolution of the Biblical tradition seems to have been formed - according to the Biblical witness - in the wilderness between Egypt and Palestine, apart from any direct contact with a pagan society; but the scene in which Aaron makes the golden calf (Exodus 32:1-10) illustrates that the Hebrews did not easily escape from their past.</p>

<p>What happened in the wilderness? Was Moses a great religious thinker who in a powerful way got at least a band of Israelites free from Egypt, led them in the wilderness and, in the context of this situation, occasionally went up to high mountains to think out his religious program? Were the mountaintop experiences of Moses eventually 'mythologized' to give those experiences the aura of deity? Or, as the Bible suggests, were the Hebrews in the wilderness under the stimulus and control of beings from another world who were deliberately seeking - for whatever motives - to plant a particular religious viewpoint within the minds of the Hebrews? </p>

<p>Bishop Robinson argues (together with those scholars whose work he has synthesized) that just as the past century fought the battle over the scientific validity of the Creation material in Genesis, so now we shall have to fight to set the Exodus stories and the New Testament narratives free from their 'mythological' world view. Robinson asks: 'Is it necessary for the Biblical faith to be expressed in terms of this world-view, which in its way is as primitive philosophically as the Genesis stories are primitive scientifically?' (1)</p>

<p>Thus, the Biblical faith attributes itself to the intervention of beings from another world. Is this necessary? I would say that it is necessary only if it is true. Bishop Robinson assumes that such a view is out of the question. I say that it must be given serious attention. From a philosophical point of view, I doubt the ease with which Robinson moves from saying that the Genesis Creation stories are myth to implying that the Red Sea episode or the Ascension of Christ is mythological. From an empirical point of view, no one could have witnessed the Creation. Whatever else one says about the Creation story, it was not told by a man who had seen Creation. But the parting of the Red Sea, and the Ascension of Christ, are reported as if they were sense experiences - and we cannot rule out this possibility a priori, as we can with the Creation material. </p>

<p>The Bible reports that Jesus was crucified, but I do not hear Bishop Robinson arguing that this is a mythological belief of the early Church. Everyone assumes that some of the eyewitness descriptions in the Scriptures have a right to be interpreted in a realistic way. The fact that many pagan religions were mythological does not automatically mean that the Christ pan faith is basically mythological. It is a live hypothesis to suppose that the beings from another world mentioned in the Bible were the cause behind the Biblical religion; although it may be easier to believe in the Crucifixion than the Ascension of Christ, there seems to be no reason why both - in the light of the space age - could not have been witnessed events of the same order. There is an essential unity in the course of a person's day if he both witnesses a man knocked down by a car as he crosses a street, and sees a man board an airplane and fly off into space. Although the two events are not identical, there does not seem to be any necessary reason why the Crucifixion and Ascension re-ports should be separated.</p>

<p>The means by which the Old Testament patriarchs receive knowledge of God is not homogeneous. God some-times seems to contact men through a vision in a dream during sleep as with Abimelech (Genesis 20:1-7), or a man may go into something like a trance or deep sleep as did Abraham (Genesis 15:12). These contacts are open to psychological interpretation, as psychologists such as Jung have shown. It is of course possible that reported visual contacts with beings from another world were in fact psychological projections - but this is not necessarily the case. When direct contact with beings from another world is made, the Bible often speaks as if direct contact had been made with God, as when three angels came to meet Abraham by his tent. 'And the Lord appeared to him [Abraham] by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men stood in front of him' 
(Genesis 18:1,2). </p>

<p>These three men came to Abraham with information that Sarah, despite her age, 
would conceive and bear a son. These men were so realistic that they ate a meal 
which Abraham prepared; Sarah laughed when she heard that she would conceive. On 
another occasion we find Jacob wrestling with a man all night - we discover that 
he is no ordinary man when the angel in desperation uses his 'supernatural' 
power to touch Jacob's hip and put it out of join (Genesis 32:24-25). It is 
interesting that these beings are described as men. They do not seem to have 
wings - they seem quite ordinary up to a point. Where do they come from and who 
are they?'</p>

<p>When Abraham had made the covenant (contract) with God, he was ordered to 
prepare on an altar an offering of pieces of slaughtered animals, which God 
would then receive as a sign that God's signature had been placed on the 
contract. After the offering was prepared, and it was dark, 'behold, a smoking 
fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces' (Genesis 15:17) 
presumably consuming the offering. Biblical scholars have been able only to conjecture as to the meaning of this 'smoking fire pot' and 'flaming torch.' Is it simply cultic symbolism, or was some-thing strange happening here?</p>

<p>Jacob was sleeping on one occasion, and he dreamed 'that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.' (Genesis 28:12) Since the Bible describes this as a dream, we will exclude it from our list of passages which might be sense descriptions, but it is an interesting dream. Jacob seems to have met angels on many occasions when he was awake, and on one occasion he met so many that he said. This is God's army' (Genesis 32:2)</p>

<p>Until the Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites do not really have a religion. They are simply living on a promise. One fundamental question about the Biblical religion is why Egypt should be willing to give up its slave labor - assuming that the Biblical witness is reliable at this point. And once the Israelites were out of Egypt, why did the Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers-Deuteronomy tradition evolve? </p>

<p>The Exodus begins when 'the angel of the Lord' appears to Moses in the wilderness and calls to him "out of the midst of a bush' (Exodus 3:2). We shall return to this passage later, but it is worth noting that the 'angel' speaks directly for God himself, much as the later prophets such as Isaiah speak for God. Moses was commissioned to get the Israelites out of Egypt and was apparently given unusual powers by which to do this; finally the first-born of Egypt were all killed on the famous 'passover' night, and Pharaoh set Israel free. Scholars have not been able to agree how many Israelites marched from Egypt, but the Bible suggests a very large number along with cattle and possessions. The Exodus account goes on to relate that Pharaoh pondered the situation and decided that he had made a mistake in freeing his slaves. He pursued the Israelites with his army in an attempt to reclaim them.</p>

<p>At no point is the Exodus story ordinary, but at this juncture the scene becomes most extraordinary. The Bible narrates that 'when Pharaoh let the people go ... God led the people round by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea' (Exodus 13:17,18). What is meant by saying that God led the Israelites? Here is the answer. The 'Lord went before them [the Israelites] by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night; the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people (Exodus 13:21,22). By means of an 'Unidentified Flying Object' God led the Israelites from Egypt to the Red Sea.</p>

<p>How does this Biblical UFO compare with modem UFOs? Modern UFOs sometimes exhibit a corona effect, which results in a white cloud-like halo appearance. Modern UFOs also usually glow in the dark, as the Biblical 'pillar of fire by night' seems to have done. But the difficult question is the significance of the Hebrew term for pillar. There are in fact two Hebrew words which have been translated pillar in the RSV: ammud and mazzebah. In this passage the word ammud is used, which may mean a cylindrical column; thus the implication would seem to be that that this UFO looked like a cylindrical column (height not specified), cloud-like during the day, but glowing in the dark. </p>

<p>It is not clear whether the 'pillar of cloud' stood vertically before the Hebrews or traveled horizontally in relation to the ground. Jacques Vallee, in his work Anatomy of a Phenomenon: Unidentified Objects in Space; A Scientific Appraisal, has found that in addition to the UFOs of the 'flying-saucer' type, there is also clearly a class of UFOs (i.e., so many of this type have been seen and described that they form a separate class from the flying-saucer type) which 'appear as huge cylindrical forms surrounded by cloud-like formations, often vertical.' (2) If the Bible is describing a UFO which appears as a cloud-like cylindrical column during the day and as a glowing cylindrical column at night, then this UFO corresponds in description with a class of modern UFOs which have been seen with considerable frequency. Occasionally these cylindrical or 'pillar' UFOs seem to act as a kind of 'mother ship' for the flying-saucer type or class of UFO, which seem smaller in dimension than the pillars from which they come.</p>

<p>But this is by no means the only possible interpretation of the Hebrew understanding of the pillar of cloud.' G.A. Barrois has pointed out that 'the miraculous pillar plays, on a supernatural level, a function similar to that of Jacob's massebah as a testimony to God's presence.' (3) On one occasion Jacob used a rock for a pillow; he had a dream of God during the night, so he set up the rock as a 'pillar' - a witness or mazzebah - and this rock, since he used it as a pillow, might have had a flatter, more saucer-like shape than the cylindrical type of pillar (Genesis 28:18). When Jacob made a covenant with Laban, 'they took stones, and made a heap' (Genesis 31:46) or pillar as a witness. </p>

<p>This heap might have appeared conical, or like a turtle back, or perhaps like an upside-down saucer. Thus it is possible to argue that the 'pillar of cloud' was a witness pillar in function, and that it may have physically resembled a flying saucer. It could be argued that the Biblical authors chose the word 'ammud rather than mazzebah, because the mazzebah became associated with the idols of the enemies of Israel and the Jews were under orders to smash these idols, 'utterly overthrow them and break their pillars in pieces' (Exodus 23:24). Thus it is possible to argue that the 'pillar of cloud' was a UFO which corresponds in description to either one of two classes of modern UFOs: the cloud-like cylindrical-column class ('ammud), or the glowing flying-saucer class (mazzebah).</p>

<p>This Biblical UFO apparently leads the Israelites throughout their forty-year journey through the wilderness, according to the testimony of the book of Exodus, and the description of this UFO is by no means consistent. Some-times the pillar of cloud is referred to as the 'Lord' (Exodus 13:21; 14:24: other reference seem to be 'the angel of God' (Exodus 14:19) 'the cloud' (Exodus 14:20), 'the pillar of fire and of cloud' (Exodus 14:24), 'the glory [brightness] of the Lord appeared in the cloud' (Exodus 16:10), 'I am coming to you in a thick cloud' (Exodus 19:9, 16), 'Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire' (Exodus 19:18), 'thick darkness' (Exodus 20:21), 'an angel' (Exodus 23:20), 'my angel' (Exodus 23:23; 32:34), 'the cloud covered the mountain' (Exodus 24:15), 'the glory of the Lord settled on Mount Sinai' (Exodus 24:16), 'my presence will go with you' (Exodus 33:14), 'the Lord descended in the cloud' (Exodus 34:5), and 'So Moses finished the work. Then the cloud covered the tent of the meeting' (Exodus 40:30-38). </p>

<p>Thus it appears that during the whole of Exodus the Israelites were accompanied by some sort of UFO, which receives its clearest description at the beginning of Exodus, between Egypt and the Red Sea. Because of its various-names, it is certainly difficult to come to a definite conclusion about the shape and size of the UFO, but on many occasions, as with its description as a 'pillar of cloud and of fire,' it seems to fit one of two classes of modern UFOs, either the cylindrical or the flying-saucer type. At this point it does not seem useful to decide in favor of one type over the other. Both are possible; the important question is, What did the Biblical UFO have to do with the Exodus?</p>

<p>The Bible suggests that this UFO, which seemed cloud-like during the day but which glowed in the dark, served as a beacon or guide which led the Israelites day and night from Egypt to the Red Sea. This UFO deliberately led the Israelites to the Red Sea, which seemed like a foolish thing to have done, because with the Egyptian army coming up from behind, the Hebrews were literally caught between Pharaoh and the deep blue sea. The Bible says Pharaoh thought the Israelites were 'entangled in the land; the wilderness has shut them in' (Exodus 14:3). Pharaoh and his army moved in for the kill, with the 'pillar' having proved a poor guide, unless the being in charge of the UFO knew ahead of time what would happen at the Red Sea!</p>

<p>The Israelites were convinced that they were finished. They said to Moses, 'Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness?' (Exodus 14:11). But as Pharaoh's army moved in, God's angel in the UFO took command of the situation. 'Then the angel of God who went before the host of Israel moved in and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them, coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness; and the night passed without one coming near the other all night' (Exodus 14:19, 20).</p>

<p>The text suggests that some sort of UFO, totally under its own control, led the Israelites out of Egypt to the Red Sea, and then as Pharaoh's army closed in, the UFO moved from the front to the rear of the army of Israel and kept the two military camps separated during the night. Is this history, myth, or a combination of both? The Bible does not say that Moses had some of his soldiers start a smudge-pot fire between the Israelites and the Egyptians. Is the Bible weaving a mythology out of a half-truth; did the Israelites somehow save themselves, or was there really some sort of UFO under intelligent control which deliberately sought to save Israel from Egypt?</p>

<p>Phase one of the operation involves leading Israel to the sea; phase two requires the UFO to keep the camps separate until darkness falls. Now begins phase three. Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided' (Exodus 14:21). (When we argue that the Israelites were on the shore of the 'Red Sea,' we are simply using the Biblical designation from the Revised Standard Version. No one knows for certain which body of water was involved in the crossing, but the Hebrew seems to suggest a swampy 'Sea of Reeds.') </p>

<p>The best scholarship of our day agrees that the Israelites were moving from west to east. Martin Noth, in his Exodus: A Commentary, says that Israel may have camped on 'the western shore of the Sirbonian Sea.' (4) Since Israel was moving from Egypt to Palestine, from west to east, logic suggests that the Hebrews were on the western shore of some body of water, and an east wind would be blowing in the faces of the chosen people. The Interpreter's Bible has argued that 'Since the wind is from the east we must assume that the crossing took place somewhere near the eastern shore of the sea or lake'; (5) the editors of The Interpreter's Bible seem to have assumed - quite rightly - that any wind strong enough to cause the parting of the sea would prohibit the Israelites from crossing the sea if the wind were blowing in their faces. Thus, without any further argument, they have concluded that Israel was on the eastern shore heading back toward Egypt! But Martin Noth and others, and the logic of the Exodus, suggest that Israel was on the western shore with the wind blowing in the faces of her people.</p>

<p>There is almost no evidence that the Israelites were able to take advantage of an 'accident' of nature. Noth has argued that there is no natural parallel to the Red Sea incident. (6) The other alternatives are to assume (1) that the whole sequence concerning the Red Sea is a fabrication; (2) that God somehow directly intervened in the situation in some unexplained way; or (3) that beings from another world were present in some sort of UFO and that they deliberately caused the sequence of events which the Bible narrates.</p>

<p>The Bible argues that the wind caused the sea to part. How did the persons present know that the wind caused the sea to part? They might have seen the sea part, and they might have felt the wind blowing, and concluded that the wind was the cause of the observed effect - the parting of the sea. But as every scientist knows, relating cause and effect can be a tricky business. It is no easy step to conclude that because a certain type of mosquito is present in a situation, it transmits malaria. The fact that a particular mosquito and malaria are present in the same situation may be mere coincidence. Thus we may very well trust the Biblical statement that the sea parted; we may also trust that there was an east wind blowing; but we are not thereby compelled to conclude that the wind caused the seat to part. Perhaps something intangible caused it to part.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why it is difficult to attribute the cause of the parting to the wind. Later in the sequence the sea falls back over the Egyptians and drowns them; they could hardly drown in only a couple of feet of water. Even if the sea were only ten feet deep at its deepest point, since water weighs about 62.4 pounds per cubic foot, at a depth of ten feet the water would be applying a pressure of 624 pounds per square foot on the bottom of the sea. It would seemingly take this amount of wind pressure per square foot to force the water back and maintain the opening. Since the Israelites were crossing, according to most scholars, from west to east, they would have to go against this powerful wind, with wives, children, and cattle. The Bible does not even mention any wind at all during the crossing. If the Israelites crossed in the face of a wind generating 624 pounds pressure per square foot, would this not be worth mentioning? Since man has about the same body density as water, it would appear that the people, like the water, would be thrown back by the wind. If the wind ceased to blow, why would the water not come back upon Israel?</p>

<p>The Bible goes on to describe the crossing of the sea 'on dry ground' (Exodus 14:22). The Israelites knew that the water had been pushed back, but they seemed surprised - perhaps shocked - that the ground was dry. The Hebrew suggests that this was a 'Sea of Reeds'; the area where the Israelites crossed may have been swampy, at least near each shore line. The Israelites undoubtedly expected that as soon as they stepped into the shore area, they would sink up to their ankles in mud. But they crossed on dry ground! Every farmer knows that a wind may dry off the surface of a newly plowed field, but it is a very slow process for the water two to six inches under the surface to evaporate. The Israelites expected to be wading in mud, when in fact the ground was dry and by implication hard. The Israelites were driving cattle, yet there is no mention that even their sharp hoofs cut through the surface soil of the sea bed. I do not believe that even a very strong east wind, blowing for part of an evening - without even the benefit of the heat of the sun - could dry out the underlying layer of mud.</p>

<p>The Bible also narrates that when the Israelites went into the sea, the waters were 'a wall to them on their right hand and on their left' (Exodus 14:22). In poetic celebration the idea is emphasized: 'the floods stood up in a heap' (Exodus 15:8). Some scholars are convinced that this idea is an 'embellishment.' If a wind were the cause of the parting of the sea, we could hardly expect a wall effect. The force of wind disperses, much as the impact of a pebble in a pond disperses in ever widening rings. If wind were to force the sea back, the result might be a very moderate concave effect, but certainly we would not expect a 'wall' on each side. A wall suggests not only vertical sides but also smoothness, and the wind would create neither vertical walls nor a smooth surface.</p>

<p>When the army of Egypt pursued the Hebrews down into the trough of the sea created by the walls on each side, Moses was told to raise his hand over the sea, and the walls of the sea broke and came back upon the Egyptians (Exodus 14:26-29). If Moses is merely taking advantage of an 'accident' of nature, it is certainly a fantastic accident that the winds would start blowing when he raised his rod and stop blowing at a later point when he raised his hand. But even more important, the Bible does not say that when Moses raised his hand the wind stopped blowing. There is no mention of any wind at all. Moses raised his hand and the water returned. There is no wind mentioned. The Israelites may have suspected that the Lord was using something besides wind to keep the walls of the sea in check.</p>

<p>In summary, a wind strong enough to force the sea back would make conditions impossible for crossing; the ground was apparently dry and hard for the crossing, which an evening's wind could hardly do; the water seems to have been held in a position resembling a wall - vertical and smooth - which wind could hardly do; and when Moses raised his hand for the water to return, no mention is made of the wind. It would seem that we are faced with a choice: if we want to believe that the wind caused the parting of the sea, then we cannot believe that vertical walls were formed, that the sea bed became hard and dry, or that it was likely that the starting and stopping of the wind would be instantaneous, as it seems to have been. The other alternative is to suppose that something other than the wind caused the parting of the sea so as to produce, symptoms such as vertical walls of water.</p>

<p>There is no way that we can be true to the Biblical text and suppose that the Israelites took advantage of an 'accident' of nature. If we want to explain everything as simply an act of God, then there is no need to discuss the text -presumably God can do anything. But there is a tertium quid worth exploring. The Biblical text makes it quite clear that some sort of UFO was in the vicinity of the Red Sea at the time it parted; if beings from another world were in the situation with the specific intention of saving the Israelites, let us see how the events described in Scripture can be reconciled with our knowledge of modern UFOs.</p>

<p>If a modern UFO were anxious to cause something like the parting of the Red Sea, it would probably use an anti-gravitational beam (anti-G beam), or something like an anti-G beam, to move the water back. Both Keyhoe and Edwards are. convinced that our modern UFOs operate according to some anti-gravitational principle, although Vallee is not so certain. The positive gravitational power of the moon orbiting the earth causes the tides in our oceans to rise; if the moon were to be endowed with an anti-G force, it would push the water in the oceans away from it rather than attracting water toward it. If a UFO were to hover over the body of water which the Israelites were to cross, and if it were to apply a sufficiently strong anti-G beam to the area which the Israelites desired to cross, the water would quite probably be forced back. Radio blackouts have been reported when UFOs have been near car radios, which indicates some kind of electromagnetic (EM) interference. UFOs are nearly silent when they move, another indication that their propulsion system could be 'antigravitational' or 'electromagnetic' in form, although modern science has not yet discovered how such a system would operate.</p>

<p>Until further evidence is available, let us suppose that UFOs operate by means of some sort of anti-G or EM beam, keeping in mind the speculative nature of this assumption. Light and gravity are both electromagnetic in nature, and it is interesting to compare some of the properties of light with gravity. Light can be focused in a 'beam' by using a concave reflector, as is done with a flashlight or with automobile headlights. One should notice that these 'reflectors' are almost 'saucerlike' in shape. Radio telescopes, used to collect electromagnetic energy from distant stars, are sometimes referred to as 'dishes' because of their 'saucerlike' shape. Radar beams are sometimes focused by saucerlike reflectors. Probably all forms of electromagnetic energy can be focused into a beam by saucerlike reflectors. Flying saucers may be circular and saucerlike in shape in order to focus their electromagnetic propulsion beam in much the same way we focus a flashlight beam.</p>

<p>According to an Associated Press newspaper report, policemen and citizens in Wanaque, New Jersey, saw a UFO which was 'saucer-shaped, about the size of an automobile and glowing with a white brilliance.' One of the policemen (Sergeant Thompson) 'said he got out of the car and continued to watch the object for almost five minutes "until the glowing light blinded me."' The article continued, Thompson said the object manoeuvred, stirring up brush and water in the reservoir. "It was about 150 feet up," he said.' Frank Edwards has remarked about the fact that UFOs have often been seen to cause a disturbance in water directly under the flying saucer. (8) How could a UFO 150 feet in the air cause a disturbance in the water beneath? An anti-gravitational or electromagnetic beam seems capable of providing an acceptable answer.</p>

<p>Returning to the Biblical material, it seems necessary in the light of our present knowledge of UFOs to find some way to move the 'pillar of cloud' from the position it took between the armies of Israel and Egypt to a position directly over the sea. The Exodus narrative does not tell us when the UFO moved over the sea. The Bible says that after the cloud moved between the two armies, 'there was the cloud and the darkness' (Exodus 14:20). Martin Noth in his commentary has observed the reference to the 'darkness' and has suggested that there is the possibility that the 'pillar of cloud and fire' did not glow in the dark on this particular night as it usually did. (9) </p>

<p>As a general rule the UFO seems to have given off enough light so that Israel could march at night (Exodus 13:21), but this light might also have enabled the Egyptians to overcome Israel at night. If on this occasion the UFO did not glow at night, then the Israelites would not have seen the pillar of cloud move during the night to a position over the sea. Once it became dark, the Egyptians would be forced to set up camp; they would be willing to wait until morning for the battle, as the Israelites could hardly go anywhere with their backs to the sea. The next time the UFO was seen by Israel, it was in fact hovering over the sea, directly over the 'channel' which had been formed for the crossing. The UFO became visible over the channel during the morning watch, at which time the sun might be giving enough light on the horizon so that the UFO could be seen even if it were not glowing (Exodus 14:24). </p>

<p>The sea did not begin to part until it was dark (Exodus 14:21), and when it finally became light enough to see, the UFO was found hovering directly over the channel (Exodus 14:24). Thus on the basis of the Biblical text it is quite permissible to argue that the UFO hovered over the sea in order to cause it to part, and directly over the sea the anti-G or EM beam would be most effective.</p>

<p>It might be argued that the Bible does not say that the UFO caused the sea to part; the Lord, according to Exodus, caused the sea to part. But Martin Noth argues that at least in the ']' tradition the cause of the parting of the sea is the pillar of cloud. (10) We read that 'the Lord in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down upon the host of the Egyptians' (Exodus 14:24); if the Lord was 'in' the pillar of cloud, and if the Lord caused the sea to part, then it would follow that the 'efficient' cause (to use Aristotle's distinction) of the parting of the sea was somehow located in the UFO.</p>

<p>It might also be argued that modern UFOs, although they may disturb water directly under them, have never caused anything like the parting of the sea. This is of course true, but modern UFOs presumably use only enough anti-G or EM power to permit their mobility; they may on most occasions displace only the equivalent of their own weight in water through the beam. </p>

<p>If a much more powerful anti-G or EM beam were to be focused on a body of water, I believe that there would be more than the relatively slight effects observed in modern times. One may then be compelled to ask: If modern UFOs are propelled by an, anti-G beam, and if such a beam would be necessary to cause the Red Sea to part, what would stabilize the UFO over the sea while this powerful beam was applied? To pose the problem in another way, suppose that the anti-G or EM propulsion system of UFOs is compared with our rocket principles which operate according to Newton's third law of motion (i.e., for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction). </p>

<p>A rocket or jet stream is focused in one direction, and the space vehicle is 'pushed' by the rocket or jet in the opposite direction. Thus when an anti-G beam is focused toward the earth, the UFO is pushed like a rocket away from the earth. A very powerful rocket may completely leave the earth's gravitational field and travel into outer space. If a UFO were to apply a very powerful beam over the Red Sea, why would the UFO not be propelled like a rocket into outer space? The answer must be speculative, of course, but it should be noted that some modern UFOs have been described as 'double-convex'; (11) that is, they are saucer-shaped on the top and on the bottom. </p>

<p>If a rocket were equipped with a propulsion jet on the top and on the bottom, aimed in opposite directions, and if both were ignited at once, the rocket ship would not move - the two power jets would cancel each other out. When two automobiles travelling at the same speed meet in a head-on collision, both may come to an immediate stop. If a 'double-convex' flying saucer were to focus equally powerful anti-G beams in opposite directions, the UFO would not move. </p>

<p>This is speculation, but at present there does not seem to be any reason to say that UFOs do not have the technical capabilities of causing the sea to part through an anti-G or EM beam. Furthermore, there is nothing in the Biblical account which prohibits us from saying that the UFO caused the parting of the sea, or that it hovered above the sea at night while the channel was formed.</p>

<p>The Bible suggests that the ground was dry and by implication hard - free from mud. An anti-gravitational force would cause everything under it in effect to become heavier -two, three, or four times heavier. Not only would the water under the UFO be forced back, but the anti-G beam would be applying pressure to the remaining muddy sea bed. The effect would be like pushing a heavy lawn roller over a sponge. The dense mud would in effect become more dense, forcing the water in the mud to the surface and then forcing that water back with the dividing 'walls.' Another fact to be considered is that many people have experienced an intense heating effect when they have come directly under a UFO. </p>

<p>This might be another side effect of the anti-G beam, because an electromagnetic beam might cause increased molecular activity in the body upon which it was focused, or the EM beam might be of such a frequency that heat is a natural form of energy release. If this effect were applied to the bed of the Red Sea, the mud might very well be 'baked' in much the same way pottery is baked; and this would also contribute to the fact that Israel seems to have been pleasantly surprised to cross on a dry, apparently hard surface, rather than having to wade up to their ankles in mud in the 'Sea of Reeds.' The 'rolling' effect together with a 'baking' effect could together account for the 'dry ground.'</p>

<p>Light is a form of electromagnetic energy, and it can be focused in a 'beam' because light travels basically in a straight line. The Bible relates that the water was pushed back and formed a wall on each side of the Hebrews. If the UFO could control an anti-G or EM beam in much the same way we control a flashlight beam, we might expect that when the anti-G beam was applied to the Red Sea the water would be pushed back only as far as the area over which the beam was applied. Furthermore, since the electromagnetic anti-G beam would presumably travel, like light, in a straight line, the effect would be the forming of a wall of water on each side of the beam. This wall would not only be vertical, but would probably appear to have quite a smooth surface, almost as if a sheet of glass were placed against each wall of the sea to hold it back.</p>

<p>An anti-G beam would travel at about the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, so that when Moses raised his hand as the signal for the anti-G beam to be turned off, the walls of water would begin to fall back on the Egyptians immediately. The anti-G beam allows for instantaneous response; it is much more efficient than a strong east wind.</p>

<p>The Bible does say that a strong east wind was blowing, at about the time the water was forced to divide and form the walls. What can we say about this? If the pillar of cloud and fire - the UFO - were hovering over the sea and applied an anti-G beam to the sea, everything under the UFO would become in effect heavier. Not only would the water be pushed back, and the mud be 'rolled' dry, but the air directly under the beam would also become heavier, and would be forced down toward the sea bed directly under the UFO beam. The walls of water on each side would form a trough or channel, and when the air hit the sea bed, it would then shoot out each empty end of the channel formed by the two walls of water. </p>

<p>If the Israelites were standing on the west bank ready to cross to the eastern shore, the wind would be hitting them right in the face as it came out of the channel - and they would report that a strong east wind was blowing. If they had been standing on the eastern bank, however, they would also have had a strong wind blowing toward them - but apparently from the west. (This wind would assist in drying off the surface of the sea bed.) As the air under the UFO was forced down, lighter air from above the UFO would be drawn down into the 'semivacuum' created as the air under the UFO was pushed down. Thus a continuous stream of air current would result. Frank Edwards reports that one UFO as it was seen to ascend into the air from fairly near the ground caused dust to be kicked up from the ground. (12) If UFOs operate according to some anti-G principle, this may be an example of how the anti-G beam forces air currents down, thus causing the 'dust' to fly. </p>

<p>There is one difficulty which must be considered, and for which there is only a theoretical answer. While it is true that a wind strong enough to part the Red Sea would be too strong to allow the Israelites with their families and possessions to cross, the anti-G beam presents similar problems. Everything under the anti-G beam would in effect become heavier. This would probably be true also for the Israelites as they moved under the beam; each man, woman, child, animal, and possession would seem to weigh several times its normal weight. If the Israelites noticed such an effect while crossing the sea, we would certainly expect them to report it; in fact, it might be impossible to cross under these conditions. </p>

<p>We are therefore forced to assume that after the water was forced back and the sea bed became dry, part of the anti-G beam was shielded off so that the center area of the channel would be free of the anti-G effects. Sometimes the moon comes between the earth and sun in such a way as to cause an eclipse - the electromagnetic light radiation of the sun is shielded off by the moon. If beings from another world were operating a UFO in the Red Sea situation, it is certainly not impossible, but probable, that their technology permitted them to shield off part of the anti-G beam or anti-G jets while allowing two powerful walls of the anti-G beam to remain, one in front of each wall of water in the sea bed. While an anti-G beam may have been applied uniformly to the Red Sea to move the water back and to roll out and bake the mud, once the water was back in the desired position some of the beam could be phased out in the center of the desired crossing area so as to permit the Israelites to cross in total freedom.</p>

<p>Such an explanation might appear to be extremely hypothetical except for the sequence which the Bible relates after the Israelites have crossed safely to the eastern shore. As the morning light began to allow the Egyptians to see what was happening, they followed the Israelites with their chariots right into the channel of the sea. The Israelites were presumably high and dry on the other side, having completed the crossing, and they looked down into the channel and observed with concern the Egyptians in hot pursuit. </p>

<p>Were the Hebrews nearly to have made this astounding escape only to be caught from behind as the Egyptians used the escape channel? No, for Moses would raise his hand as a signal for the walls to fall in on the Egyptians, but before the walls of water collapsed, something strange seemed to be happening to the Egyptians down in the channel. We read, 'And in the morning watch the Lord in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down upon the host of the Egyptians, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians, clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily' (Exodus 14:24,25). The King James Version is closer to the Hebrew than the RSV, however. It reads, 'And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians. And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily' (Exodus 14:24,25).</p>

<p>The Bible does not tell us when the UFO moved into a position directly over the sea bed. The last time we heard about the UFO it had settled down between the armies of Israel and Egypt. The Egyptians apparently set up camp and waited until morning to make the next move. Then the UFO moved over the sea under the cover of darkness, causing the sea to part. The Israelites did not see the UFO hovering over the channel until the first light of day, and by that time the Hebrews had completed their crossing and were looking down at the Egyptians in the trough of the sea.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were having some kind of difficulty, and the text suggests that the 'pillar of cloud' was the cause of the crisis. The Egyptians were perhaps pointing up toward the UFO over their head, thus suggesting to the Israelites that whatever the distress, its cause was above them.</p>

<p>The Lord (or the angel of God) in the UFO looked down upon the Egyptians in the channel of the sea bed and 'discomfited' or 'troubled' the Egyptians. The Hebrew suggests that the Lord 'looked' down upon the Egyptians with such a powerful force that he 'crushed' them - to speak as the Bible sometimes does about a heavy heart suggests a 'troubled' heart. The Egyptians seem to have been 'crushed' or 'troubled' or made 'heavy' by the 'looking down' of the Lord in the UFO above them. Apparently the UFO had somehow caused the Egyptians suddenly to become very heavy - the anti-G beam was once again applied to the whole area of the sea bed. The shield which had freed part of the sea bed from the anti-G beam so that the Israelites could cross was suddenly removed. </p>

<p>This shield was not removed until many of the Egyptians had driven their chariots a considerable distance into the channel; otherwise they would in all likelihood not have been able to enter the trough at all. Everything seemed to be going well as the Egyptians pursued with their chariots down into the center of the channel, when suddenly the Lord 'looked down' on the Egyptians and knocked them flat. They were crushed by an invisible weight.</p>

<p>The King James Version follows the Hebrew in telling us that the Lord in the UFO caused the wheels of the Egyptian chariots to come off. The RSV translators could not make sense of the Hebrew, so they turned to a Syrian word which suggested that the wheels of the chariots became 'clogged.' Probably the RSV translators assumed that the chariot wheels became stuck in the mud; but as was made very clear during the crossing of the Israelites, there was no mud to be found - they crossed on hard, dry ground. Where did the mud suddenly come from? Not only has the RSV been untrue to the Hebrew in suggesting that the chariot wheels were clogged rather than removed, but the idea of 'mud' has been introduced, which the previous narrative strictly excludes. </p>

<p>If the anti-G beam were once again applied to the whole sea bed, the chariots would suddenly weigh two to four times as much as normal, or more; the pressure on the axles of the chariots might well cause the axles to bend or break, thus removing the wheels. Furthermore, the narrative specifically draws attention to the UFO above as the cause of the difficulty, not to the mud below. The Lord 'looked down' upon the chariots with a great force and broke off their chariot wheels.</p>

<p>Not only were the wheels removed, but the chariots appeared to drive 'heavily.' The Israelites on the shore saw the Egyptians suddenly knocked down or crushed by extra weight, and the chariot wheels were broken off. They also undoubtedly saw the horses either knocked to the ground by the extra weight, or at least straining greatly, so that the chariots appeared to drive 'heavily'; everything, in fact, had suddenly become much heavier. In the face of these difficulties the Egyptians wisely concluded, 'Let us flee from before Israel; for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians' (Exodus 14:25). But this decision came too late for the Egyptians down in the channel; as soon as the anti-G beam was lifted, the waters came back upon the Egyptians. The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not so much as one of them remained. But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on the left' (Exodus 14:28,29). If part of the anti-G beam had not been shielded off in order to allow the Hebrews to cross, they too would have been crushed by the same powerful 'look' from the UFO which 'discomfited' the Egyptians.</p>

<p>At this point it is worthwhile to examine and compare the value of the above interpretation of the Red Sea incident with other interpretations. There have been at least two attempts to link the pillar of cloud and of fire with some natural phenomenon. Martin Noth has suggested that when the Israelites came to Mount Sinai they met a volcano, and this volcano made such an impression on the Hebrews that they introduced the idea into the narrative of the whole Exodus story. (13) Of course a volcano cannot move around the way the Biblical UFO apparently does. </p>

<p>In another interpretation, A.H. McNeile has suggested that ancient peoples sometimes marched 'carrying braziers containing burning wood at the head of an army'; (14) thus a burning smudge pot carried in front sent up a pillar of cloud to lead the army in a march. While this type of UFO is more mobile than a volcano, it is obviously a man-controlled entity, whereas the Hebrew narrative leaves no doubt that they were not controlling the 'angel of God'; rather, the UFO was controlling them. They followed it. Of its own initiative it moved from in front of Israel to the rear to separate the Egyptian army from Israel. The UFO apparently caused the parting of the sea, and crushed the Egyptians under it in the channel. If scientists should eventually establish that UFOs exist and that they operate by means of some kind of anti-G or EM beam, then my interpretation would seem to have several advantages over either the 'volcano' or the 'smudge-pot' interpretation of the pillar of cloud and of fire. </p>

<p>If we take as our starting assumption the basic Biblical testimony - that the Israelites were under the guidance of an external force - then we can assume that the being in charge of the pillar of cloud knew ahead of time that the army of Israel would be saved from Egypt by the parting of the sea, and all this implies. We are in a much better position to make sense of the narrative by assuming that whatever extraordinary things are involved in the Red Sea experience, the direct cause of these things lies in the UFO which seems to be in charge of the situation.</p>

<p>As in all Biblical narratives, we may ask the question:</p>

<p>Did the Biblical story arise as a 'mythological' fabrication of a fairly ordinary or even extraordinary human experience - was an unusual experience given a 'mythological' religious perspective? Or was there really some external agent in the situation - in the UFO - which deliberately caused the unusual sequence of events which Exodus relates? If we do not believe that beings from another world in a UFO were in the situation, how did Israel escape from Egypt? Egypt was not anxious to give up its slave labor. We may even wonder about the various plagues which originally struck Egypt and brought Israel's freedom.</p>

<p>The only point at which we have not been true to the Biblical narrative is in saying that the direct cause of the parting of the sea was not the strong east wind. But there was apparently an east wind blowing out of the channel. Our interpretation is in fact true to all the 'sense-data' which the Biblical narrative provides. Our only exception to the narrative is in point of theory - the Biblical connection between cause and effect, between the parting of the sea and the east wind. The 'east wind' may well have distracted us from looking to the true source of the parting - to the UFO which hovered over the sea - to the angel of God in the pillar of cloud and of fire.</p>

<p><b>The Pillar Of Cloud After The Red Sea</b></p>

<p>We cannot help being interested in the activity of this UFO - this pillar of cloud and of fire - after the sequence of events at the Red Sea. There was no doubt in the minds of the authors of the Biblical material that the UFO was intimately concerned with the whole Red Sea narrative, which explains why the UFO is given such a prominent role at this juncture. Furthermore, the Bible maintains that this UFO was present during the whole of the Exodus, including the forty years in the wilderness. While the role of the UFO is never more dramatic than at the sea, there are several occasions on which the UFO plays a major role, which must now be examined.</p>

<p>The Israelites had not traveled far beyond the Red Sea when they discovered that they were in the middle of the wilderness without any source of food, and they began to think that they had been better off as slaves sitting by the 'fleshpots' of Egypt (Exodus 16:3). But now the sea which had set Israel free from slavery stood in the way of a return to Egypt - and the fleshpots. But the UFO was still in charge, and the Lord said to Moses, 'Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you' (Exodus 16:4). </p>

<p>Moses instructed Aaron to explain to the Israelites that the Lord would provide bread. 'And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud' (Exodus 16:10. For the Biblical frame of mind, the bread which covered the earth like dew in the morning was somehow connected with, or caused by, the UFO which led Israel safely across the Red Sea. Clear also is the fact that the promise of bread from heaven would be fulfilled only if Israel followed the glory of the Lord - the bright cloud -into the wilderness. If you wanted bread, you had to follow the UFO. This 'stimulus' and 'response' conditioning is certainly in the best psychological tradition. In the book of Numbers we see quite clearly that the Israelites followed the cloud; 'whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel encamped' (Numbers 9:17).</p>

<p>Donald Keyhoe, in his work The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, devotes a chapter to what he calls 'Angel Hair,' which seems to be a fine flake-like substance which has been observed dropping from UFOs. (15) This 'Angel Hair' sometimes, although not always, disintegrates when a person touches it, and it very often evaporates in the heat of the sun. Whether or not anyone has tried to eat this substance, I do not know! But the description of the 'bread from heaven' is strikingly parallel. 'And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as hoarfrost on the ground. When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" [manna] For they did not know what it was' (Exodus 16:14,15); 'it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey' (Exodus 16:31). And in the morning the Israelites gathered enough for their daily use, except on the sixth morning, when they gathered enough for two days; the Israelites did not gather every piece of 'manna,' or 'what is it?' in sight, and 'when the sun grew hot, it melted' (Exodus 16:21). If this is mythology, it is certainly interesting myth - the Israelites seem to have invented an imaginative bread from heaven so esoteric that they were hard pressed even to name it, so they called it 'manna - what is it?'</p>

<p>This is further evidence that there really were beings from another world in the situation, and that the beings in the UFO were responsible for the distribution of some type of food which the Israelites were hard pressed to describe. It may be that the beings in the UFO 'seeded' the air with a fine food dust which dropped to the ground, absorbing the dew; when morning sunshine provided light, perhaps the food dust worked like yeast and grew into the small 'flake-like thing' which the Israelites ate. For our future space travel it will be useful to develop foods which, when combined with water, yield a substantial bulk. Moses on occasion provided water for the Israelites by striking a rock with his rod (Exodus 17:1-7), so it is not surprising that Moses was a powerful commander. It was after these various physical needs were met - freedom from Egyptian enslavement, freedom from hunger and thirst - that the beings in the UFO, the angels of God, proceeded to give the Hebrews a Law, a religion.</p>

<p>Thus the Sinai tradition, with its Ten Commandments, begins by saying, because 'I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage,' 'You shall have no other gods before me' (Exodus 2o:2, 3). Before the commandments were given, Moses was told to gather the Israelites around the foot of Mount Sinai, because 'the Lord will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people' (Exodus 19:11). The Sinai tradition is very lengthy and is not easy to unravel, and we shall not attempt to clarify the textual problems. </p>

<p>Moses apparently went up and down the mountain several times. He went to the top to talk with God - or with the angel of God (Exodus 23:20, 23) - came down to talk to the people at the foot of the mountain, then returned to the top. Moses remained at the top of the mountain to talk with the angel of God for long intervals of time - the Bible suggests forty days and nights (Exodus 24:18), which is the Bible's way of saying a long time. In fact, Moses spent so much time on the mountain that the people became restless and started dancing and singing, making molten calves, and generally having a rollicking time; the people 'rose up to play' (Exodus 32:6).</p>

<p>On at least one occasion a special demonstration of the power of God was displayed on Mount Sinai. The people were gathered around the foot, and then God descended on the mountain. 'On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God; and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. And Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain quaked greatly' (Exodus 19:16-18). This description has led scholars to suppose that the Hebrew people were witnessing volcanic activity, and the suggestion has been carried further that because of this volcanic experience the Jews developed their understanding of God on the basis of this experience.</p>

<p>But volcanic activity is not the only explanation which might fit this description. On November 2, 1957, just before midnight (according to Jacques Vallee), two men traveling on Highway 116 in Texas saw a 'bluish-green torpedo-shaped machine 150 to 200 feet long which remained close to the ground for two or three minutes, then ascended, its color changing to red.' The presence of the UFO had caused the motor of the truck to stop, and the headlights were cut off. The men gave this account:</p>

<p>We first saw a flash of light in the field to our right, and we didn't think much about it - then it rose up out of the field and started towards us, picking up speed. When it got nearer, the lights of my truck went out and the motor died. I jumped out and hit the deck as the thing passed directly over the truck with a great sound and a rush of wind. It sounded like thunder, and my truck rocked from the blast. I felt a lot of heat. Then I got up and watched it go out of sight toward Levelland. (16)</p>

<p>The report of the 'rush of wind' might be due to the movement of the ship, or to the downward thrust of the propulsion beam, as reported during the Red Sea episode. It is not impossible that a UFO of the type seen in Texas -torpedo-shaped, or like a pillar or cylinder - could have caused the flashing light, and the thunderings, and if the truck rocked from the blast of the UFO, perhaps the whole mountain would quake if a tremendous anti-G force were applied. The whole purpose of the Mount Sinai scene was to demonstrate to the Israelites the power of God, for at least three reasons: The people of Israel were about to receive a religious code, and God was powerful enough to demand obedience. The Israelites needed confidence in the power of their God in the face of their enemies - if God is for us, who can be against us? The demonstration would make it clear that Moses had been chosen by God to be his prophet; only he dared go near the UFO. 'Lo, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you [Moses] for ever' (Exodus 19:9).</p>

<p>The people were warned several times not to 'touch' the mountain when the UFO descended on it (Exodus 19:12; 21;24). There were religious reasons for this commandment, for this was a holy mountain; but if there was a power display on the mountain, it might have been dangerous for anyone to be on the mountain. It is interesting that Moses was shielded from danger when coming near the UFO, although after long periods in the presence of the 'thick cloud' his face developed a peculiar 'glow' (Exodus 34:29-35).</p>

<p>A mountain shooting forth lightning, thunder, and smoke like a kiln does suggest a volcano, but one does not usually find people climbing volcanic mountains as the Bible suggests Moses did; and furthermore, one could climb to the top of every volcano in the world and never encounter a being at the top of the volcano who would dictate copy for two stone tablets containing the fundamental ethics for a world religion. Of course, many people are skeptical of this whole tradition; they suppose that Moses took advantage of this volcanic display to go up the mountain, quickly write out some commandments on a couple of stones, and then return with what he called the Commandments of God. But there is one element of the Sinai tradition which, if it is to be trusted, rules out the 'volcanic' explanation of the smoke, thick cloud, and lightning. The Bible says that 'the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain' (Exodus 19:20). This noisy, thick cloud did not come up from the inside of the mountain; rather, it came from above the mountain and settled upon it. </p>

<p>We have a description here which probably points to the same pillar of cloud and of fire of the Exodus, carrying out some kind of spectacular activity. Martin Noth argues that the 'cloud' at the Red Sea and at Sinai have a common tradition, (17) and with this we agree. We believe that this common tradition was not derived from a volcano, however, but from some sort of UFO which resembles modern flying saucers. Then it makes more sense to conclude with the Bible that Moses went to the top of the mountain to converse with a being in the 'cloud.'</p>

<p>Another Sinai passage points more clearly to the 'pillar of cloud' tradition. Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. The glory of the Lord settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. Now the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel. And Moses entered the cloud' (Exodus 24:15-18). Moses seems to have gone aboard the UFO, at which time he received stone tablets from the being in the UFO (Exodus 24:12) and also received specifications concerning the construction of the Tabernacle (tent of worship and sacrifice) for the children of Israel. 'According to all that I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle, and of all its furniture, so you shall make it' (Exodus 25:9). </p>

<p>When one considers the detailed information which Moses apparently received from the being in the 'cloud' (roughly Exodus chapters 20-35), it is no wonder that a considerable amount of time was required for the Sinai experience. Much time was also required to collect the materials and build the Tabernacle. Supposedly before Sinai the Israelites had almost no religious tradition at all, and after Sinai they had the fundamentals of a religion which has been practiced for over three thousand years. Once these fundamentals were established, a considerable amount of time was spent in the wilderness while these principles became operational (the Bible suggests about forty years). As soon as their faith became functional, Israel moved into Palestine, the Promised Land. When Moses came down from the mountain after receiving the first tables of stone, he broke them in anger at finding the people returning to their pagan pattern of behavior (Exodus 32:15-19). Moses eventually cut a second set of stone tables, and again 'the Lord descended in the cloud' (Exodus 34:5) to meet with Moses.</p>

<p>Notice that as the experience with the UFO continues, it is no longer called a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, or even a pillar of cloud, but simply the 'cloud.' The abbreviated form is developed very early in the Exodus account; it is in chapter fourteen of Exodus that the Red Sea incident is described, and throughout this account the UFO is usually referred to as the 'pillar of cloud and of fire,' or a similar long form, but even at the sea we find the short form used once. After the UFO settled between the armies of Egypt and Israel before the parting of the sea, we read, 'And there was the cloud and the darkness' (Exodus 14:20). When the Israelites followed this bright cloud-like UFO into the wilderness, 'the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud' (Exodus 16:10). Just as UFO is our abbreviation for Unidentified Flying Object, so 'the cloud' is frequently the abbreviation for the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. As the Exodus narrative continues, a shorter form is almost always used.</p>

<p>Once the Tabernacle had been built, the UFO moved into a position directly above the tent. Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle' (Exodus 40:34). This 'cloud' served as Israel's beacon throughout the journey in the wilderness. 'For throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel' (Exodus 40:38). The book of Numbers is even more emphatic that this cloud dictated every move Israel made; when the cloud moved, Israel moved, and when the cloud rested, Israel made camp (Numbers 9:15-23). </p>

<p>Scholars have been led to speculate that the pillar of cloud and fire arose out of the sacrificial tradition of the Jews. When burnt offerings were sacrificed on the altar, smoke went up from the tent, moving from earth to heaven, and thus stimulating the tradition that the 'pillar of cloud' represented the presence of God. But as we have seen, it is quite late in the Exodus that the Tabernacle is built, and supposedly Moses received the information of how to build the Tabernacle from the being in the cloud-like UFO on Mount Sinai. Thus the volcano and the sacrificial-cloud explanation of the origin of the pillar of cloud both have to assume that an experience which occurred late in the Exodus was, so to speak, written back into the early Exodus tradition.</p>

<p>But none of these explanations - that the pillar of cloud was smoke from a fire pot which served as a beacon, or the visual impression of a volcano, or the result of the smoke and incense of a sacrificial tradition - can account for the continuous Biblical assumption that this 'cloud' contained a being with whom Moses was involved in almost day-to-day conversation. When the being in the cloud wanted to talk to Moses, the UFO seemed to descend from its position above the tent (Numbers 11:25). At one point Miriam (Moses' sister) and Aaron criticized Moses for taking a Cushite wife, and they even wondered why Moses should be the only prophet in Israel. </p>

<p>The being in the UFO apparently overheard the discussion: 'And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting." And the three of them came out. And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward. And he said, "Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord make myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house. With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in dark speech; and he beholds the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"' (Numbers 12:4-8) Miriam developed 'leprosy,' and Israel had to remain in camp seven days until she was cured. UFO authorities such as Coral and Jim Lorenzen have noted that people have frequently developed skin irritations after a flying-saucer contact. (18)</p>

<p>The destruction of the Egyptians at the Red Sea, the warning to Moses not to come near the burning bush, the warning to keep away from Mount Sinai, and the experience of Miriam all suggest that it was dangerous to get too close to this UFO. The Tent of Meeting, with the UFO hovering above it, was purposely kept outside the camp for the protection of the people; apparently it was dangerous to get too close to the 'Presence' (Exodus 33:7). On one occasion we read, 'And the people complained in the hearing of the Lord about their misfortunes; and when the Lord heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burned among them, and consumed some outlying parts of the camp' (Numbers 11:1); only Moses' intercession saved the situation. It is not surprising that this UFO commanded the respect of the Israelites.</p>

<p>The passage dealing with Miriam, Aaron, and Moses is enlightening, for all three persons are recorded to have heard the voice coming from the UFO. This was not simply a subjective experience of Moses, and in fact the angel in the 'cloud' underlined the fact that Moses received 'direct revelation' in contrast to the fogginess of a 'vision' or dream which was the usual mode of revelation for prophets. The best way for God to make himself known to man, according to this tradition, is for him to speak man to man with some chosen person. Man by nature has certain physical and psychological limitations which God seems to have taken into consideration; God might even make himself best known by coming as a man (Jesus Christ), or at least by sending representative mediators or angels to make himself known.</p>

<p>One may very well wonder on the basis of the Old Testament passages whether God himself was present in the cloud, or whether an angel of God was in the UFO. In the Old Testament tradition we often find ordinary men -Amos, Isaiah, and Jeremiah - speaking for God. They say, Thus says the Lord.' We never suppose that God himself is literally speaking; these men are simply mouthpieces for God. If men can serve as mouthpieces for God, then certainly angels would have the right to speak for God, as they often do in the Bible. In the New Testament we find a very important speech by Stephen, his defense before the Jews who were about to stone him to death for his Christian beliefs. In this speech Stephen gave a short summary of the whole Mosaic tradition, and he clearly stated that the Hebrew faith was 'revealed' to Moses by an angel or group of angels. Stephen is recorded as having said, 'Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him [Moses] in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush' (Acts 7:30). Stephen went on to say, 'This Moses whom they refused, saying, "Who made you a ruler and a judge?"</p>

<p>God sent as both ruler and deliverer by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush' (Acts 7:35).</p>

<p>Stephen here clearly implied that me same angel who appeared to Moses in the bush was also instrumental in leading Israel safely out of Egypt through the sea - the pillar of cloud and fire. What can we say about the incident of the 'burning bush'? We read in the Bible that 'the angel of the Lord appeared to him [Moses] in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and lo, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed' (Exodus 3:2). Moses was out in the wilderness looking after his father-in-law's sheep, and religion seems hardly to have been on his mind when he noticed a 'bush' which appeared to be on fire yet did not 'burn up.' This was probably as much excitement as Moses could hope to have in the course of the day; he approached the bush and must have been quite shocked when a voice came to him, 'Moses, Moses' (Exodus (3:4).</p>

<p>The text records that the angel of the Lord was in the 'midst' of the bush. This word midst is important; the Hebrew word bush actually means a thicket, suggesting a clump of bushes, and the 'angel' of the Lord was in the midst or middle of a clump of bushes. In other words, it makes sense to suggest that the angel of God in the pillar of cloud and of fire which led the Israelites through the Red Sea and the wilderness had on this occasion settled down on the ground into the midst of a clump of bushes -a thicket. The UFO in the thicket made the whole clump of bushes appear to be on fire, but apparently the thicket was not consumed by the presence of the UFO, and this combination of circumstances caught Moses' attention. Since we have already seen how Moses spoke with the being in the UFO at Mount Sinai and at the door of the Tabernacle, we should not be surprised to find a voice coming out of the thicket which called, 'Moses, Moses ... I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' (Exodus 3:4-6). While this voice may not surprise us now, it undoubtedly surprised Moses at the time.</p>

<p>Having made this observation about the way in which Moses seems to have been called, let us return to Stephen's address. Stephen continued to refer to Moses and the UFO when he said, 'This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living oracles to give to us' (Acts 7:38). Notice that tor Stephen, and apparently in the consensus of opinion of the early Church, the angel who met Moses in the 'burning thicket' was also the angel who led Israel through the sea - in the pillar of cloud and fire - and to Mount Sinai, and with whom Moses spoke in the cloud at Mount Sinai. Stephen went on to say, 'Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen' (Acts 7:44). </p>

<p>Stephen concluded by saying, 'And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it' (Acts 7:52, 53). Stephen and the New Testament authors assumed that God commissioned beings from another world to come and make directly known to the Hebrew people the religion or 'living oracles' they were to obey. Jesus is reported to have said that no one 'has seen the Father except him who is from God; he has seen the Father' (John 6:46), which seems to imply that no one other than Jesus himself had ever seen God.</p>

<p>It seems quite fantastic to suggest that beings from another world came and deliberately carried out the sort of activity which is ascribed to the pillar of cloud and of fire. But if beings from another world came to earth with the intention of molding a specific religious perspective on a group of people - chosen people, the Jews - and if these beings in their UFO caused the parting of the Red Sea, provided manna in the wilderness, put on a display of power at Mount Sinai while giving Moses various instructions, and finally led Israel through the wilderness to the Promised Land, hovering night and day over the Tent of Meeting, then I dare say that the people involved in this sequence, the people who were under the influence of the beings in the UFO, might very well record the events in which they were involved. And if they were specifically told by the beings in the UFO that they should react in a religious way to these events, they might be inclined to do so. In brief, the Mosaic tradition is best explained as the visible effect caused by the UFO recorded to have been in the situation, a UFO under intelligent control. Beings from another world deliberately attempted - and succeeded - in molding a people committed to a particular religious tradition.</p>

<p>What happened to the UFO which led the Israelites out of Egypt through the wilderness to the Promised Land? The answer to this question is not clear. After Moses died, the leadership was turned over to Joshua, who was more a general than a prophet. Nevertheless the Lord, or the angel of the Lord, promised Joshua, 'No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you' (Joshua 1:5), Israel seems to have moved from Egypt through the wilderness of Sinai south of Palestine, marching below the Dead Sea before turning north along the eastern shore of that sea until they were some distance above the point where the Jordan emptied into the 'Salt Sea,' or the Dead Sea. </p>

<p>Thus it was Joshua's task to lead Israel across the Jordan, from the eastern shore to the west into the territory of Jericho, the first city to be taken. Joshua seems to have been permitted to remain in the presence of the pillar of cloud even as a young man, while Moses was still in charge (Exodus 33:11). Many of the Biblical texts imply that the UFO continued with Israel throughout the wilderness journey (Exodus 23:20; 32:34; 33:2; Numbers 9:15-23), and it is entirely possible that the UFO led Israel to the eastern bank of the Jordan, at which time Joshua took over. There seems to have been a continuation of contact between Joshua and the Lord, as there had been between Moses and the Lord.</p>

<p>The Bible suggests that Israel crossed the Jordan during a flood, and it was apparently necessary to stop the flow of the river in order to make the crossing possible. The priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant moved ahead of Israel and stepped into the river, as the Lord had commanded, and as soon as the priests were in the Jordan 'the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap far off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off; and the people passed over opposite Jericho' (Joshua 3:16). The 'natural' explanation of this crossing is that a landslide stopped the flow of the Jordan; but again the Biblical text is very clear, with all its elaborate preparation, ceremony, and precision timing, that the Hebrews believed that the stopping of the Jordan was not an accident of nature, but rather an act of the Lord, or the angel of the Lord, If the pillar of cloud was still leading Israel at this time, it would be appropriate that the cloud should move over the river at the same time as the Ark of the Covenant moved over the river, since throughout the journey the UFO had hovered over the tent which housed the Ark. The text records that the 'waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap far off' (Joshua 3:16).</p>

<p>This is precisely the description of the experience of the Hebrews at the Red 
Sea, except that with that sea there were two walls, or two 'heaps'; since the 
Jordan was flowing, rather than a standing body of water like the Red Sea, only 
one 'wall' was needed to protect Israel. The anti-G beam could very well account 
for this phenomenon, as in the case of the Red Sea, although the UFO is not 
specifically mentioned. The fact that the 'heap' was far off may not so much 
mean that the Israelites did not see what was happening; rather, the geography 
of the Jordan may have dictated the place where the water could be dammed up. 
The banks may have been fairly low at the point of the crossing for the sake of 
convenience. </p>

<p>When the Jordan was backed up, high banks would be needed to contain the 
water as it rose in height, and perhaps such banks could be found near the city 
Adam. Men would not be likely to build a city in an area where the low banks of 
the Jordan permitted flooding. Joshua told the Israelites that the cause behind 
the parting of the Red Sea and the stopping of the Jordan was the same. He said, 
'For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you 
passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us 
until we passed over' (Joshua 4:23). It is certainly in line with Biblical 
thought to say that the Lord 'in the pillar of cloud' caused the parting of the 
Red Sea and 'heaped' the waters of the Jordan by the same means. The Bible 
records no landslide. It probably would have if there had been one.</p>

<p>Once Israel successfully crossed the Jordan, the people celebrated the Passover, eating of the fruits of the Promised Land. 'And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they ate of the produce of the land' (Joshua 5:12). This is another indication, together with the stopping of the Jordan, that the UFO was still present. How long the UFO remained after the crossing is not clear. Soon after the crossing 'a man stood before him [Joshua] with his drawn sword in his hand' who claimed to be the 'commander of the army of the Lord' (Joshua 5:13,14). Joshua was ordered to take off his shoes, for he, like Moses (Exodus 3:5), was standing on holy ground. Apparently the commander or 'angel' came to instruct Joshua concerning the military task which lay ahead of him. Jericho fell by an unusual series of events. The army of Israel, preceded by the Ark of the Covenant, marched around the city of Jericho for a week, and finally, at the order of Joshua, everyone shouted and 'the wall fell down flat' (Joshua 6:20). On another occasion the sun appeared to stand still for a whole day while Israel fought (Joshua 10:12-14).</p>

<p>Whether the pillar of cloud had anything to do with these events is not clear, although they would perhaps be easier to understand if some external agent were in the situation. It is clear, however, that after the Jordan was crossed and the manna ceased, Israel was more and more on its own. The army had to fight many fierce battles and often had to pay a high price in blood. Its battles were not always successful or decisive. However long the UFO or the 'angel of the Lord' may have remained with Joshua, the Bible suggests that because of Israel's disobedience, the angel finally said, 'I will not drive them [Israel's enemies] out before you; but they shall become adversaries to you' (Judges 2:3). The implication here is that the angel of the Lord departed from Israel about the time of Joshua's death (Judges 2:8). It is quite likely that if the pillar of cloud accompanied the Israelites across the Jordan into Palestine, it did not remain constantly with Israel after this period, and it may be that the UFO did not provide explicit leadership for Israel within a few days, or at most a few years, after crossing into Palestine. In the Promised Land a new era began for the Hebrews. While they did have prophets who had visions, there seems never to have been a prophet who compared with Moses. Elijah was perhaps second in line to Moses, and there is some UFO material in connection with Elijah which is worth mentioning.</p>

<p>When Elijah had apparently finished his life on earth, we read that 'the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind' (II Kings 2:1). Elisha, who was Elijah's successor, was apparently with Elijah as the latter was taken away. The two men were walking together, And as they still went on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven' (II Kings 2:11). Moses and Elijah were separated by history, so that we need not expect this brief encounter with a UFO to have brought forth an immediate 'pillar of cloud' response from the person who seems to have been the lone witness, Elisha. One gains the impression that it was customary for Elijah to disappear in some sort of UFO, for Elisha's fellow prophets ordered a search for Elijah; 'it may be,' they said, 'that the Spirit of the Lord has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley' (II Kings 2:16; see also I Kings 18:12).</p>

<p>One other interesting aspect of the departure of Elijah in some sort of UFO is the fact that Elijah and Elisha apparently crossed the Jordan to meet the heavenly whirlwind or chariot. There were fifty men watching at a distance as Elijah and Elisha stood next to the river. Then Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the water, and the water was parted to the one side and to the other, till the two of them could go over on dry ground' (II Kings 2:8). Immediately after the crossing the UFO appeared and Elijah was taken away, and Elisha took up the mantle which Elijah had left behind, and 'went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. </p>

<p>Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?" And when he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other; and Elisha went over' (II Kings 2:13, 14). The fifty men on the opposite shore apparently witnessed Elisha's return and concluded, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha' (II Kings 2:15). There is no explanation immediately available as to why the Jordan stood in a single 'heap' for Joshua, whereas it parted in much the same manner as the Red Sea parted for Moses in the case of Elijah and Elisha. Perhaps the river was flowing slowly, or perhaps the men crossed in an area of the Jordan which formed a basin. But in each of the four cases a UFO was probably in the vicinity of the parting or stopping of the water, although in the case of Joshua this conclusion is drawn mainly by implication of the whole Exodus program. In each case, however, the event was a sign of the delegated authority of the prophet involved.</p>

<p>Elijah was in close contact with some force from another world. He held a contest on Mount Carmel between Baal and God, and fire fell on Elijah's offering and consumed it (I Kings 18:38); like the Red Sea incident, this was not understood by the Hebrews as an accident of nature. Baal was really the Nature God; it would be ironic to explain Elijah's success as an accident of nature! After the contest Elijah had to run for his life and he ran to hide in a cave in the hills of Mount Horeb 
- where Moses first met the angel of God. While Elijah was in the cave, 'the 
Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broke in 
pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after 
the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the 
earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still 
small voice. And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and 
went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice 
to him, and said, &quot;What are you doing here, Elijah?&quot;' (I Kings 19:11-13). </p>

<p>Although the text does not specifically state that a 'cloud' was hovering 
outside the cave, the indications that a UFO was present are strong. The 
anti-gravitational pressure which was evident at the Red Sea and at Mount Sinai 
again caused some physical consequences, including quite a gust of wind due to 
the downdraft, and the anti-G beam also displaced some rocks, causing a bit of a 
landslide and perhaps an earthquake effect. After the dust and rocks had settled 
down, Elijah, like Moses, heard a voice. Elijah covered his face to shield 
himself from the brightness of the UFO as he moved out to the entrance of the 
cave.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that the 'cloud' tradition made some impression on later Hebrew literature. In the Psalms we find that the 'pillar of cloud' is seen as a vehicle by which God travels - it is not God himself; 'lift up a song to him who rides upon the clouds' (Psalm 68:4). It is this same God who 'makest the clouds thy chariot' (Psalm 104:3); here is a possible link between the 'cloud' tradition of Moses and the 'chariot' tradition of Elijah. While the language is figurative, its origin in Hebrew tradition seems to be concrete. When Jeremiah wishes to speak about the mobility of God, he says, 'Behold, he comes up like clouds, his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles - woe to us, for we are ruined' (Jeremiah 4:13).</p>

<p>A discussion of UFOs in the Old Testament usually includes an evaluation of the vision of Ezekiel, who saw UFOs which resembled 'wheels' (Ezekiel 1:1-28). This vision does fit in very well with descriptions of flying saucers, but Ezekiel's experiences are different from the pillar of cloud tradition in that he alone seems to have had the vision. Ezekiel's vision was not so fundamental to the Hebrew faith as the work of Moses, although it may have been a valid prophetic experience. It seems quite logical to suppose that if beings in UFOs spent forty years developing the Hebrew community of faith, appointed prophets would quite likely have occasional contact with the angels of God. But the Biblical faith could have survived without Ezekiel's vision of 'wheels'; without the 'pillar of cloud' of Moses there would have been no Biblical religion.</p>

<p>We have not exhausted the activities of UFOs in the Old Testament; it is worthwhile to compare the visions of Isaiah 6 and Ezekiel 1. We have attempted only to show that in our present theological and scientific situation certain facts cannot be ignored, (i) 
There would never have been any Old Testament religion without the Mosaic 
tradition - the Pentateuch. (2) The acts of God in the 'pillar of cloud' were 
fundamental in bringing about the Pentateuch. (3) This importance is summarized 
many times in later Biblical books as in Nehemiah 9:9-25. (4) Not only does this 
'pillar of cloud and fire' apparently resemble modern UFOs, and perhaps flying 
saucers, but this UFO is associated with the 'angels' of God, men or beings from 
another world. </p>

<p>If the Mosaic tradition accurately describes events which happened in 
history, and if flying saucers exist, then I think we can be fairly certain that 
beings in a UFO quite similar to - if not identical to - flying saucers were the 
immediate cause behind the Old Testament religion. This proves neither that God 
was working in the Old Testament nor that he was not working in the Old 
Testament. We have shown only that many of the fantastic things reported in the 
Old Testament apparently happened in much the way as the Bible has reported 
them. The Old Testament may have a fairly high degree of scientific accuracy.</p>

<p>Two other observations may be helpful in closing this chapter. First, we have attempted to separate dreams and psychic visions from visual Biblical UFO reports. But we cannot be sure that any civilization capable of operating the 'pillar of cloud' would not also be capable of inducing psychic visions through some extrasensory technique. A total understanding of the Old Testament may require a radical union of psychology and physics. Our attempted separation between the psychic and physical may be arbitrary at several points.</p>

<p>Second, it should be noticed that eventually the Temple of Solomon replaced the Tabernacle of Moses as the Hebrew center of worship. The 'glory' and 'cloud' of the Lord also hovered over the Temple on occasion (I Kings 8:10,11; II Chronicles 7:1-3), and the Temple then became the locus of UFO visitations to priests and prophets as in Isaiah 6. It was therefore fitting for Luke to begin his New Testament Gospel with the story of how the angel Gabriel appeared to the priest Zacharias in the Temple to announce the future birth of his son John the Baptist (Luke 1:5-23).</p>
