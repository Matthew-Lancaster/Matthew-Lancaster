<p>Speaking about 'flying saucers and the future' may immediately bring to mind the question of whether or not UFOs carrying beings from another world might someday land in force on earth. This is in fact what the Bible predicts, but not in the sense which modem UFO writers suggest. It may be that some or many of our modern UFOs carry beings from another planet, and perhaps someday they will land, and we can exchange scientific information with them, or trade animals with them; we might start an 'interplanetary zoo.' There are all kinds of possibilities in this realm, but the possibility also exists in the Biblical realm, in terms of the day of judgment and the second coming of Christ.</p>

<p>When Jesus was taken up into heaven in a 'space cloud,' two men 'in white robes' said to the disciples - 'This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven' (Acts 1.11). The New Testament indicates that in the future Jesus will return to earth in triumph, glory, and judgment. At this time of judgment the 'dead' will be raised, and will be carried to heaven. It is extremely hazardous, even from the scientific point of view, to try to 'predict' the future, and yet empirical philosophy is quite convinced that the best type of scientific verification - or falsification - is based on prediction and fulfillment. Thus a good scientist may predict an eclipse - and if he is a good scientist, the eclipse will occur as predicted. </p>

<p>The Bible predicts many things, but in particular it predicts (or prophesies) that Christ will return in the future and that all men will be raised from the dead, some to salvation and some to damnation. The concept of flying saucers helps clarify what for some people may seem like strange doctrines. In the Apostles' Creed Christians state that they believe that Christ ascended into heaven, and 'from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in ... the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting.' Thus when we speak of 'flying saucers and the future,' we have in mind not so much interplanetary cultural and scientific exchange as the eternal future of every person on the face of the earth. </p>

<p>It is because of the eternal implications of flying saucers that the idea of flying saucers is so important. If flying saucers contain beings from another planet who may soon contact us, this is also important. But if flying saucers contain beings from the resurrection world about which the Bible speaks, and if the Biblical religion provides the clue to eternal existence, then flying saucers gain eternal significance. Eternity may be more important to some people than interplanetary cultural exchanges. In this chapter we shall examine two extremely difficult Biblical concepts, both of which are eschatological and both of which are related to UFOs; flying saucers and the second coming of Christ, and flying saucers and the resurrection of the body.</p>

<p><b>Flying Saucers And The Second Coming Of Christ</b></p>

<p>There have been two major pitfalls throughout the history of the Church in regard to the doctrine of the second coming of Christ: There have been those who have sought to 'predict' the date of the second coming, and there have been those who have sought to dismiss the doctrine entirely.</p>

<p>At the Ascension the apostles were told by two beings from another world that Christ would someday return in the same manner as he ascended into heaven. Bishop Robinson, in dismissing the Ascension of Christ, by consequence must dismiss the doctrine of the second coming. The disciples, just before the Ascension, asked Jesus 'Lord will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?' (Acts 1:16). The answer Jesus gave has unfortunately been ignored by a segment of the Church. Jesus said, 'It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority' (Acts 1:7). If Jesus would not reveal the date of his second coming to his disciples, we can hardly expect him to reveal the date to someone in the middle of the twentieth century. </p>

<p>It is possible that Jesus himself did not know the 'date' of his apocalyptic coming, for on one occasion he said, 'But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only' (Matthew 24:36). The only clear advice in the Bible is shown in the parable concerning the wise and foolish maidens waiting for the coming of the bridegroom (Christ). Jesus concluded, 'Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour' (Matthew 25:13).</p>

<p>Isaac Newton, who is admired as one of the greatest scientists of all time, was also an excellent, though heterodox, theologian. His favorite Biblical book was the Revelation to John, a book which had often been used by theologians as the basis on which to 'predict' the second coming of Christ, together with other historical events. But Newton made no predictions concerning the second coming of Christ, although he was firmly convinced that the second coming would someday occur. Newton said in reference to the Apocalypse:</p>

<p>The folly of interpreters hath been, to foretell times and things by this prophecy, as if God designed to make them prophets. By this rashness they have not only exposed themselves, but brought the prophecy also into contempt. The design of God was much otherwise. He gave this, and the prophecies of the Old Testament, not to gratify men's curiosities by enabling them to foreknow things; but that, after they were fulfilled, they might be interpreted by the event, and his own Providence, not the interpreters, be then manifested thereby to the world. (1) Thus, while I think that flying saucers provide an excellent means of entering into the Biblical thinking concerning the second coming, we are by no means in any better position to predict any dates. Nearly two thousand years have elapsed since the 'first coming,' and there may be two thousand or two hundred thousand years between now and the second coming.</p>

<p>But while I do not believe that we should predict dates, I also do not believe that we should give up the idea of the second coming. The trend in theology since the nineteenth century has been to reject the idea of the second coming of Christ. </p>

<p>This rejection was summarized and crystallized in Albert Schweitzer's work The Quest of the Historical Jesus. (2) The early church apparently expected that Christ would return in triumph and glory within a few years - perhaps within the lifetime of most of the new converts. This expectation of an early return, of 'the eschaton,' helped missionary fervor, but as the coming was 'delayed,' questions arose about the doctrine. Schweitzer and others have argued that since the second coming has been delayed for nearly two thousand years, it appears that Jesus, or the early Church, or both, were deluded concerning this doctrine. It is clear that in the Bible, the 'time' element was never settled. Schweitzer has argued in effect that since the second coming has not occurred yet, it will never occur. As time goes on this argument becomes more convincing. But if Christ-should return, that would end the argument.</p>

<p>What does the New Testament indicate concerning the manner of the second coming of Christ? The manner is usually expressed in 'apocalyptic' language, which is quite different from narrative. Many Christian scholars have given apocalyptic messages historical interpretation, and the combination of the idea of 'flying saucers' and certain of the apocalyptic sayings attributed to Jesus offers a possible historical explanation or prediction of the second coming.</p>

<p>Here is one passage of Scripture attributed to Jesus which apparently relates to his second coming. 'Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other' (Matthew 24:29-31). Some Interpreters suppose that the sun, the moon, and the stars are symbolic of various early rulers and kingdoms and thus tend to give the passage a totally historical interpretation without any understanding of a disturbance in nature; that is, they do not expect the celestial stars to fall, but rather the kings and presidents on earth to be the 'falling stars' who will be replaced by the Son of Man.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there do appear to be 'heavenly' aspects to this passage. There is the problem of what is signified by 'the sign of the Son of man in heaven,' and also the fact that all the tribes on earth 'will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.' The idea of the coming of the Son 'with the clouds of heaven' has its origin in a vision of the prophet Daniel (Daniel 7:13), the only occasion on which the phrase clouds of heaven is used in the Old Testament. It seems reasonable to conjecture that there is some connection between the 'pillar of cloud' or the bright cloud of God's glory which led Israel through the Red Sea, and the idea of 'clouds of heaven.' The 'pillar of cloud' presumably originated in heaven. </p>

<p>In the Old Testament there is nothing that parallels the New Testament understanding of heaven, although the Old Testament people seem to have believed in life after death. It is only with Christ that the idea of heaven really comes into its own, for he claims to have originated in heaven - as he said, Tor I have come down from heaven' (John 6:38). When Daniel uses the phrase clouds of heaven, he does not make any reference to the glory of God, but in this passage in Matthew the heavenly clouds seem to supply the 'power and great glory,' which is quite consistent with the Mosaic tradition and with the bright cloud of the Transfiguration. At the Ascension it was reported that Jesus was 'lifted up' and taken away in a cloud, and the two men standing by in 'white robes' reported that Jesus 'will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven' (Acts 1:11). </p>

<p>If the Ascension is a historical event, and if the prophecies concerning the second coming are to be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the Ascension passage, it is permissible to say that Jesus will return to judge the earth in a flying-saucer-like UFO, his space cloud, Ms heavenly cloud.</p>

<p>The other thing to notice about this whole sequence in Matthew is that Jesus does not intend to return alone. Whereas throughout the whole New Testament the power of God is underplayed, the gospel is hidden in the lump, at the day of judgment, and of the second coming, the power which was seen in the UFO at the Red Sea will once again be seen, this time in connection with Christ. Previously the power of Christ was hidden, but in the future his lordship will be made manifest over the whole earth, he will return in some sort of UFO with great power and glory (brightness), 'and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call.' </p>

<p>At the second coming Christ will not return alone, but rather will have a whole army of angels. Matthew on several occasions connects judgment and the second coming with angels. 'Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age. The Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers, and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear' (Matthew 13:40-43). Both Mark and Luke bear witness in parallel passages to this basic apocalyptic perspective. One suspects that a whole 'fleet' of UFOs would be required to bring this 'army' of angels. 'For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay every man for what he has done' (Matthew 16:27), and when he has returned with these angels, Christ 'will sit on his glorious throne' (Matthew 25:31). </p>

<p>The Gospel of John indicates that these angels come through an 'opening' in the heavens (John 1:51). Christ compares his coming to the flood which came during the days of Noah (Matthew 24:37-39), and also to the raining of fire and brimstone on Sodom (Luke 17:28-30). As the floods of water and fire came suddenly upon the earth, so will the flood of angels with their leader, the Son of man. 'For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of man be in his day' (Luke 17:24).</p>

<p>Modern flying saucers have recorded speeds estimated on radar in excess of 
18,000 miles per hour. Whether or not something like flying saucers will execute 
the second coming of Christ together with an army of beings from another world I 
do not know, but at the present time I do not see any way this can be ruled out. 
Apocalyptic language is 'cloudy,' and when Christians do not know the exact or 
proper interpretation of an obscure passage, they must have the courage to say 
that they do not know the answer. But the fact is that if flying saucers do 
exist, then we would have what empirical philosophers such as Wittgenstein have 
suggested the Christian faith does not have; that is, an empirical basis for the 
verification (or falsification) of Christian religious statements. </p>

<p>Some Christian scholars have suggested that life after death - life in the 
resurrection world - might constitute a basis for empirical verification of 
Christianity. But philosophers generally have objected to the idea of placing 
verification in an invisible realm. Flying saucers, and the possibility of the 
second coming of Christ, open up the possibility that the Christian faith could 
be verified or falsified in this world. This would mean that religious 
statements are open to verification, and are either true or false, and not 
meaningless as some philosophers have suggested.</p>

<p>We have not 'proved' that the Christian religion is true, although we are trying to discover evidence which will give the faith a greater degree of probability; but obviously many areas of doubt remain. Ritchie Calder, in his book Science and Our Lives, suggested that 'Science has been defined as "Proof without Certainty" and Faith as "Certainty without Proof."' (3) Unfortunately, Christians sometimes try to claim more 'certainty' than they have a right to, and they may attempt to shame their fellow Christians who have doubts. Christ did want men to be certain about him, but one cannot force oneself to believe by pulling up on Ms own bootstraps of faith. Faith comes through hearing and seeing, as the disciples saw and heard Christ. </p>

<p>You do not have to see and touch Christ to believe; you can trust the eyewitness reports. Seeing is not necessarily believing. When Christ appeared after his Resurrection to his disciples, 'some doubted' (Matthew 28:17). When we witness an event which is contrary to all other human experience, we may discount it. The Christian life is not one of total certainty -as Paul maintained, we walk by faith, not by sight, 'for now we see in a mirror dimly' (I Corinthians 13:12). When a person confesses belief in Christ, God is at work (Matthew 16:17); no one can accept Christ on the basis of simply seeing Christ perform miracles; no one comes to Christ, according to Jesus, 'unless the Father who sent me draws him' (John 6:44).</p>

<p>The whole problem of belief, doubt, certainty, and proof is very complicated in the light of the Biblical material, and the problems focus around how one knows the truth. Even people who see the truth will not recognize it if they are not prepared inwardly - psychologically - to accept the truth when they see it. A Christian is a person who has decided prayerfully, intellectually, and scientifically that all the inward and outward evidence has led him to base his life on the assumption (correct or incorrect) that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he died for the sins of men, that he rose from the dead, and that one day he will return to raise all men from the dead. This is an 'operational definition' of a Christian. Physical evidence, or scientific evidence, of the resurrection is not enough to make a person a Christian. A person also needs the resurrected Christ 'living within him.' </p>

<p>A man needs both physical and spiritual evidence. Psychology and medicine are now beginning to see that the physical and mental are intimately linked. Man needs an internal and external witness to the resurrection, and it would seem to be a duty of the Church to make the Biblical witness to the physical resurrection as probable (scientifically and Biblically) as possible. While I would not say, using Calder's terms, that we can have 'proof of the resurrection without certainty,' nevertheless I would say that there are degrees of evidence which make the physical resurrection either more or less probable. If Jesus really is the Christ, the evidence will eventually show this to be the case.</p>

<p>The suggestion that science is proof without certainty and faith is certainty without proof may arise from the Biblical distinction between the sheep and the goats, or between light and darkness. But there are shades of light and darkness: some sheep are more faithful than others; occasionally there is the lost sheep. In one parable Jesus speaks of a sower who went out to sow: some seeds were devoured by the birds; some fell on rocky ground, sprouted, but were quickly scorched by the sun; other seed fell among thorns and was choked out by them; but still other seed fell in good soil bringing forth grain, 'yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold' (Mark 4:8). </p>

<p>The concept of yield may point to 'works' rather than 'faith,' but faith and faithfulness are directly proportional according to Biblical thinking. Thus it seems that there is something like a matter of 'degree' in the concept of faith, just as truth in science is a matter of degree or probability. A Christian might be a person who is convinced that there is a 60 per cent chance that Jesus is the Christ - in both a conscious and subconscious sense - and he might accordingly yield twentyfold. It is conceivable that a person might think there is less than 1 per cent chance that Jesus is the Christ, and he might decide that he wanted to live out his life as a Christian, although this seems unlikely. This is a rather 'mechanical' analysis of a parable which is expressed in organic terms of life. But the breach between science and faith does not seem to be the difference in the way each interprets the nature of proof and certainty.</p>

<p>Three decades ago Enrico Fermi postulated that a very peculiar 'something' or form of energy was missing from an atomic equation. Fermi knew the quantity of energy which was missing, but he concluded that this energy had neither a positive nor a negative charge, it had no mass, and because of these properties he named it the 'neutrino.' Fermi's neutrino caused a considerable scandal in the field of science because no one could capture it - it had very elusive properties. Some scientists were certain that the whole idea was a fraud, that such an energy particle just did not exist. </p>

<p>Some scientists thought that it might even be Intellectually dishonest' to continue to discuss the neutrino and its role in atomic physics. But other men were convinced that the neutrino was 'there' and that eventually it could be captured. Stubborn scientists who 'believed in the neutrino' even though no one had ever seen it or seen any experimental sign of it tried experiments with scintillation counters for several years until finally they succeeded in 'capturing' the neutrino, in showing that the neutrino existed. (4) What can be said about the mental state of those scientists who persisted in looking for the neutrino? St. Anselm would have said that these were men of faith who were seeking understanding - fides quarens intellectual. </p>

<p>A Christian can have 'faith' that the second coming of Christ will occur; interpreting the second coming in relation to flying saucers may be one way - or perhaps the way - in which the second coming may be understood. The man of science and the man of faith are not in very different positions in respect to their methods, although their subject matter is, of course, different. Both scientists and theologians very often have to repent - they make mistakes - but occasionally they stumble onto the truth, one brick at a time.</p>

<p><b>Flying Saucers And The Resurrection Of The Body</b></p>

<p>The New Testament maintains that all men shall someday be raised from the dead in a new body - a resurrection body. It is this doctrine above all others which has led critics to say that the Christian faith offers pie in the sky bye and bye.</p>

<p>More precisely, however, all will be raised; not everyone gets to eat pie. Those who do not obey the gospel of Christ 'shall suffer the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of the Lord' (2 Thessalonians 1:9). The resurrection of all men is usually, although not always, closely linked with the second coming of Christ; furthermore, the resurrection world is the world of angels. We might expect that there would be some link between the idea of flying saucers and the Biblical concept of the resurrection. We shall examine briefly only two basic questions: (i) When will the resurrection take place, and (2) How will it take place?</p>

<p>The resurrection will take place either immediately after a person dies, or at the second coming of Christ, or perhaps a combination or variation of both times.</p>

<p>While Jesus was dying on the cross, one of the two thieves who was crucified at the same time apparently accepted Christ and his kingly power. Jesus said to him, 'today you will be with me in Paradise' (Luke 23:43). The Apostle Paul believed that if he died he would join Christ immediately. He says, 'I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account' (Philippians 1:23, 24). He can also say that Christians 'long to put on our heavenly dwelling' (2 Corinthians 5:2), that is, their heavenly body. We have also seen in the Gospels that Jesus thought Abraham witnessed his coming. Moses and Elijah apparently met with Christ, Peter, James and John at the Mount of Transfiguration. There are certainly enough passages in the Bible which indicate little if any delay between this life and the next so that it can be argued that life after death is immediate. There were only three days between the death and Resurrection of Christ, whether or not this has any relevance here:</p>

<p>On the other hand, Jesus said that 'every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day' (John 6:40). The 'last day' is the Judgment Day, the day of Christ's second coming. In one of his letters Paul talks about those Christians who have 'fallen asleep' - that is, died - before the coming of Christ. Paul explains that in the day of judgment those who have 'fallen asleep' will be raised and taken to the Lord first, and they will be followed by those who are still alive on earth (I Thessalonians 4:13-18). We shall discuss this passage in detail when we examine the 'how' of the resurrection. But for the moment we can conclude that there is considerable Biblical evidence that the resurrection will not take place until the second coming of Christ.</p>

<p>The third alternative is to believe in two resurrections. The book of Revelation speaks about a special group of Christians, apparently martyrs, who were raised to life again, and they 'reigned with Christ a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life again until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection' (Revelation 20:4, 5). It could be argued that God raises some of the special saints and prophets either immediately or ahead of everyone else. Elijah was taken up into heaven immediately, and Moses and Abraham seem to be alive. Perhaps the apostles have also shared in an early resurrection; Paul may have known that this applied to him (Philippians 1:23, 24).</p>

<p>The problem of the 'when' of the resurrection has caused considerable controversy in the Church for some time. Unfortunately, the concept of flying saucers does not clarify the passages which deal with the 'when' of the resurrection, any more than UFOs clarify the passages dealing with the 'when' of the second coming of Christ.</p>

<p>But if UFOs do not solve the problem of the 'when' of the resurrection, they do shed some light in a possible explanation of the 'how' of the resurrection. Let us examine Paul's description of the second coming and the day of resurrection in I Thessalonians: 'For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first; then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord' (I Thessalonians 4:16,17). The second coming of Christ heralds the day of resurrection. Christ expected to return from heaven 'in the clouds' with angels and with great power. Paul also adds that both those 'asleep' and those 'alive' shall be 'caught up' 'in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.' If we substitute 'UFOs' or 'flying saucers' for clouds, the passage is consistent with scientific possibility.</p>

<p>There is one other occasion on which Paul speaks of being 'caught up,' which in the Greek suggests that one is taken up by force, and this is how Paul describes his experience in II Corinthians. He speaks about his own 'revelations,' although to avoid boasting he speaks as if he were talking about another man. He says, 'I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven -whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into Paradise - whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows - and he heard things that cannot be told' (II Corinthians 12:2-4). There is a real tension in the mind of Paul on this occasion as to whether he was 'caught up' in his own body or not. </p>

<p>Since Paul did not know, we can hardly know, but he himself could not rule out the possibility that he was somehow 'caught up,' forcefully taken to 'Paradise' in his own earthly body where he saw and heard unspeakable things. Either Paul was lost for words, or else he did not understand the heavenly language. In keeping with our earlier discussion on the 'degrees of faith' and the degrees of verification to which a Christian may be subjected, it is fair to say that if Paul endured the experience of being taken away to Paradise in some sort of UFO, a 'heavenly cloud,' then we can well understand his firm conviction concerning the Lordship of Christ, and the future resurrected life in Paradise. In this passage in II Corinthians Paul does not mention any sort of UFO as being responsible for the fact that he was 'caught up,' but it would probably have been consistent with his Damascus Road experience, and his discussion in I Thessalonians of the experience of being 'caught up' in the 'clouds' at the second coming of Christ.</p>

<p>Returning to I Thessalonians, we have seen that those who have been raised from the dead will be forcefully taken 'in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.' If we interpret the word cloud in a straightforward sense, we of course have difficulty scientifically seeing what Paul could mean. But if we interpret the passages in the light of modern UFOs, the situation changes.</p>

<p>This passage in I Thessalonians also brings to mind the fact that angels, apparently in charge of a fleet of 'clouds,' will help execute the day of judgment and resurrection. In telling the story of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus said, 'The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom' (Luke 16:22). Here again is an indication that angels have something to do with the transportation of the resurrected person to his eternal abiding place.</p>

<p>Interpreting the concept of the resurrection in light of flying saucers underlines more than ever the fact that man's future life in heaven will be spent in a body of some kind. What will this body be like? Paul speaks much about the resurrection body, which he once described as a 'spiritual body' (I Corinthians 15:44), but we have seen that he simply means that this is a body which will be appropriate for man's heavenly existence. Paul uses the word spiritual here because it is the opposite of physical, and it fits the pattern of opposite in this whole passage. He says, 'What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body' (I Corinthians 15:42-44). Realizing that the term spiritual body is almost self-contradictory - spiritual and body -Paul adds an extra sentence to apologize for putting these opposites together. 'If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.'</p>

<p>In II Corinthians Paul speaks of man's resurrection body as a 'heavenly dwelling,' which is equivalent to his idea of a spiritual body. He says, Tor we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Here indeed we groan, and long to put on our heavenly dwelling, so that ... what is mortal may be swallowed up by life' (2 Corinthians 5:1-4). The term heavenly body would be the best way to describe our resurrection body, for the term spiritual body can be somewhat misleading, as Paul seems to have realized. If the resurrection body of Christ is the prototype of the resurrection body of all Christians, then it seems clear that man's 'heavenly dwelling' or 'spiritual body' can be concrete enough so that Thomas could touch it.</p>

<p>One can certainly argue, however, that the resurrection body of Christ is no ordinary body, and certainly neither the Bible as a whole, nor the Apostle Paul, maintains that the resurrection body is identical in form or content with man's earthly body. While Thomas did touch Christ, Christ appeared after the doors were shut - whether Christ came through a 'space tunnel' or whether his resurrection body could move through closed doors we do not know. Jesus appeared to, and walked with, two disciples on the Emmaus Road, but somehow the disciples did not recognize Jesus: 'But their eyes were kept from recognizing him' (Luke 24:16). Luke lays the fault on the eyes of the disciples rather than on the body or appearance of Jesus. Their eyes were 'opened' when Christ broke bread before them, and after they recognized him, he 'vanished' (Luke 24:31).</p>

<p>Christians have long argued concerning the relation between the old and the new body. Some have supposed that every 'atom' which was in a person's body when he died would somehow become reunited to form the resurrection body. But many informed Christians have realized that when a person dies his body decays and may become fertilizer for plants, which in turn can produce fruit for another man to eat. What about the atom which belonged to the body of two or more men (separated in time)? This sort of argument took place before the atom was smashed and before demythologizing, so this argument seems peculiar. Part of the difficulty may lie in the fact that men have used the Resurrection of Christ as a precise model by which to understand our own resurrection, which may not be the best policy. Luke records that when the women came to the tomb on the first day of the week, they found the stone rolled away, 'but when they went in they did not find the body' (Luke 24:3), that is, the dead body of Christ. </p>

<p>They found an empty tomb, except that two men in 'dazzling apparel' were present to explain that Christ had risen. This sequence suggests an almost one-to-one relation or continuity between the earthly body of Christ and his resurrection body, but are we justified in trying to find in Christ's Resurrection a precise model for our own resurrection? Christ's Resurrection did for the apostles what the experience of being 'caught up' to Paradise did for Paul: it gave them a firm impression of the message they were to preach and a more complete perspective of God's plan for mankind.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to understand the relation between our earthly and heavenly body is to use, with the Apostle Paul, the analogy of the seed. Paul has been stressing how important it is to believe in the resurrection. He says, 'But some one will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?" You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the body which is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. For not all flesh is alike, but there is one kind for men, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. There are celestial bodies and there are terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another .... So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable' (I Corinthians 15:35-40, 42).</p>

<p>There are two warrantable conclusions which can be drawn from this passage concerning the relation between the earthly body and the resurrection body. The resurrection body has a higher degree of 'glory,' or brightness (as the clothing of angels seems to be bright), than man's earthly body. It is more desirable, as it is more desirable to have the body of a man than of a fish (presumably). Notice that if our earthly body is the 'seed' for our resurrection body, then there is apparently some continuity between our world and the resurrection world. Human 'seeds,' the male sperm and the female egg in this life, carry chromosomes which determine the physical characteristics which will be part of the new body which grows from the union of the sperm and egg. How we might find an analogy in our own body and in the resurrection body to parallel the idea of genes and chromosomes is difficult. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is what the Bible means by the idea of the human 'soul'; if Paul is correct in saying that there will be some continuity between our earthly body and our heavenly body, then perhaps there is some kind of 'energy precipitate' which, like a tape recording or like the DNA molecule, can be carried through time and space and then be 'played back' when the desired moment and place are found. There is a new type of instant coffee which is made by percolating the coffee in the manufacturing plant, freezing the 'cup' of coffee, and evaporating the frozen liquid until crystals are formed, which are then shipped to market for distribution. When coffee is desired, hot water is added to the 'precipitated' or 'freeze-dried' particles of coffee. Perhaps when the human body dies, there is some human 'energy precipitate' which can later transfer the real stuff of human personality - the coffee - to a new body. Absurd speculation perhaps, but analogy seems to be the only route by which the resurrection can be understood from the human side. </p>

<p>In his well-known book Varieties of Religious Experience, William James has recorded experiences of persons feeling the presence of an unseen force. (5) Others have reported being by the bedside to witness the death of an individual, and supposedly seeing a glowing light energy leave the dead body. Whether or not this light energy points to an 'energy precipitate' or to what Paul calls the 'seed' which will sometime be transformed into the resurrection body, only time will tell.</p>

<p><b>Where Do We Go From Here?</b></p>

<p>First of all, I believe that we must be willing to accept a kind of principle of uncertainty in our search for truth. This is not only a scientific principle, but it appears to have been the basis of man's response to God, since men from Abraham to the Apostle Paul have walked by faith, not by sure knowledge. We have to be willing to live in a state of tension, a state of expectation that in time the truth will more completely unfold. I have frequently been asked, 'Do you yourself believe that the parting of the Red Sea was caused by some sort of UFO?' My answer is 'Yes, about 80 per cent.' I say this because I believe that I must leave room for doubt, so that I will be open to new evidence when it comes in.</p>

<p>My strongest belief is that there is room for much more research within the field I have explored in this book. Not only is there a need for an exhaustive study of the nature and function of the various Biblical reports of UFOs and of the reports concerning the appearance of angels, but there is a need to study related subjects such as the glory of God and the throne of God, in both the Old and the New Testaments. We have left untouched the whole problem of evil, including 'the devil and his angels' (Matthew 25:41), although it is worth mentioning that by far the majority of Biblical references to angels are to 'good' angels.</p>

<p>There is also a need for the theological community to try to maintain better contact with what is happening in the physical sciences. In an age of both theological and scientific specialization this is extremely difficult. An Old Testament archaeologist may not know much more about existential theology than a biochemist knows about geology, and none of these people may know much about cosmological speculation concerning the expanding universe, or experimental confirmation of certain aspects of the theory of relativity. Since new discoveries are constantly being made in each field, it is difficult enough to keep up a single field without trying to keep up in several fields and build bridges between them. But I believe that many of our current theological problems have arisen because we have not been willing to build the necessary bridges between science and theology. </p>

<p>This cannot be a one-man effort. It must become a special field in itself. The bridge between theology and the social sciences has been quite well established and has become a specialized field. But this specialized field has in fact been 
largely responsible for the death of God theology, which is overwhelmingly oriented toward the psychological sciences. If equal effort had been placed in the attempt to keep up with the physical sciences, we might well have avoided many of the theological problems which now surround us.</p>

<p>I am most anxious to underline that I consider most of the hypotheses in this book to be quite tentative. I do not doubt that in time my perspective will seem very limited. But it is my hope that I have seen enough to encourage others to take a closer look at the same territory, and to make their reports.</p>
