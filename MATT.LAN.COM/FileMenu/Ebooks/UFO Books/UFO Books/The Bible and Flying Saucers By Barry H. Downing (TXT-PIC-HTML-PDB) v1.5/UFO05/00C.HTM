<p>It has been five years since the original publication of this book, and it is only appropriate that I make some comments concerning my understanding of the continued validity of this work. I am more convinced than ever that the Biblical faith was strongly influenced by, if not deliberately caused by, beings from another world, wherever and whatever that world may be.</p>

<p>I am not making any basic changes in the text of this work, although my exercise concerning the 'probability' that we will place a man on the moon seems unusual now that it has happened. But the exercise was very real when I did it, and I only hope my other 'guesses' in this book turn out to be as accurate as that one. It is worth noting that sometime after men had landed on the moon, several people in a major American city did not believe it had happened. They all thought it a trick played by the television people. The whole question of what to believe and what not to believe is indeed difficult.</p>

<p>It is especially appropriate that a British edition of my work be published, since Bishop John A.T. Robinson stimulated me to discover some alternative answers to the questions he raised in Honest to God. Also, it was while I was a student at the University of Edinburgh that the thesis for this book developed, and in fact I heard Bishop Robinson deliver a lecture while I was there.</p>

<p>The only chapter of this book which might have needed serious revision is Chapter Two, 'What is the Probability that Flying Saucers Exist?' But in fact things have not changed much. The governments of the world still claim UFOs do not exist. And people continue to claim they see UFOs. On the one hand, since this book was originally published, Dr. Edward Condon has published the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, a study sponsored by the U.S. Air Force, which concludes there is no proof that UFOs are space vehicles from another world. At the same time, almost one third of the cases considered by Dr. Condon's group were finally labeled as 'unidentified'; that is, there is no known explanation. </p>

<p>There is no proof, but there is evidence. Perhaps the most important book on UFOs is Dr. J. Allen Hynek's The UFO Experience, published in 1972. Dr. Hynek was for twenty years U.S. Air Force advisor on UFOs, and is chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University. Dr. Hynek concludes, tentatively, that UFOs are a new scientific phenomenon, probably extraterrestrial in origin. Charles Bowen's work with Flying Saucer Review in England has also made a positive contribution to the whole UFO issue. At this point I would say there is some UFO activity which supports my thesis, and some that does not. It will probably be some time before conclusive proof is available, one way or the other. </p>

<p>Erich von Daniken's book Chariots of the Gods? has of course provided archaeological evidence to support my thesis at the other end of the time spectrum. My book hinges on proving that UFOs are here now, and that they were there then - when the Bible was developed. I do not recommend von Daniken as a careful Biblical scholar, nor as a theologian, but I think he has helped us make some important psychological adjustments.</p>

<p>I have asked the editors to include two articles in this edition which were not in the original publication of this book. My article 'Ancient Astronauts and Religion' (Appendix 
1) is a general view of the relation between von Daniken's work and my own. This was originally published in the U.S.A. in the Binghamtown Evening Press. </p>

<p>Also to be included as Appendix 2 is the article Radiation Symptoms in Exodus, originally published in the May-June 1972 issue of Flying Saucer Review. While both these articles repeat some of the concepts in the book, they both also contain some new material which I believe is worth adding. These articles, together with this foreword, seem to me to bring the book sufficiently up to date.</p>

<p>I am very thankful that my work will now have a wider reading in Britain. It is the home of my ancestors, my second home, and the birthplace of my older son. I hope this work will stimulate all who read it to wonder in a new way what life and the Scriptures are about.</p>
