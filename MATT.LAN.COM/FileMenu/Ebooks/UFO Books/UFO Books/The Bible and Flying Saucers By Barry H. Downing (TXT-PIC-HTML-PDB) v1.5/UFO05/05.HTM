<p>If the Biblical religion was planted and nurtured by persons from another world, it is only natural that we should wonder where these beings come from. Keyhoe, Edwards, and others who have written concerning flying saucers have suggested that the only likely explanation is that these beings come from another planet, either within or without our solar system. Bishop Robinson begins his Honest to God by saying. The Bible speaks of a God "up there." No doubt its picture of a three-decker universe, of "the heaven above, the earth beneath and the waters under the earth," was once taken quite literally. </p>

<p>No doubt also its more sophisticated writers, if pressed, would have been the first to regard this as symbolic language to represent and convey spiritual realities' (1) Bishop Robinson's chief objection to the Ascension passage in the book of Acts is that it reflects this 'primitive' notion of a three-decker cosmology.</p>

<p>It is wise when reading the Biblical material, at least from an empirical point of view, to try to separate what the Bible reports as apparent 'sense data' from the conclusions the Bible gives us about the significance of the sense data it reports. It may be that on most occasions we will want to accept both the 'sensual' report and the 'conclusion.' Thus the Bible may report that Jesus died on the cross, and it may draw the conclusion that the blood of Christ shed on the cross saves us. We may want to accept both the 'data' and the 'conclusion,' or we may want to accept only the data. </p>

<p>In the case of the Red Sea incident, I accepted the data that an east wind was blowing, but I did not accept the Biblical conclusion that the wind caused the water to part. Bishop Robinson seems to have reasoned that since he cannot accept the Biblical conclusion that we live in a 'three-decker' universe, this automatically permits him to dismiss the 'sense data' which the Bible reports concerning the fact that Jesus was taken off into space by some extraordinary 'cloud.' The 'demythologizers' have not made this epistemological distinction clear. It is entirely possible to admit that the Biblical cosmology was primitive without concluding that the 'sense data' the Bible reports was false. </p>

<p>We may not live in a three-decker universe, but the disciples may still have seen Christ taken off into space. After bringing up the subject of the 'three-decker' universe, Bishop Robinson then admits that some writers would have regarded this as 'symbolic language to represent and convey spiritual realities.' What does he mean by 'symbolic language' and 'spiritual realities'? He means that when man starts talking about the invisible, language often becomes (of necessity) obscure. But the Bible makes it clear that many of the most important realities in the universe are invisible. Scientists who like to 'see' everything may not like this, but the Bible says that this is the way things are. In Colossians we read that Jesus Christ 'is the [visible] image of the invisible God' (Colossians 1:15). God is invisible, Jesus taught his disciples to pray, 'Our Father, who art in heaven.' </p>

<p>If God is invisible, probably heaven is invisible. How does man get to know an invisible God? First, God, though invisible, nevertheless literally is present to, and surrounds, every living being (Acts 17:28). Second, God sends his angels to the earth to make himself known, and finally reveals himself in Jesus Christ, the visible image of the invisible God. This is the basic Biblical argument. The question must now be raised: How can Jesus Christ and angels be visible on earth and invisible in heaven?</p>

<p>The answer which might be given by persons who believe that UFOs come from another planet is that they would be too far away to be seen. This is a possibility, but from a theological point of view it may be objectionable to suggest that heaven is on another planet. There seems to be a difference in the Bible between the 'heavens' (planets, stars), which God created with the earth, and 'heaven,' which does not seem to be created. (2) Heaven - and hell -should be entirely different universes, as the 'three-decker' universe of the Bible suggests. But our universe seems to be homogeneous. Is there any way in which a 'three-decker' universe might exist in terms of modern science, in such a way that the Christian idea of angels and of the resurrection of the body might be true, and still permit heaven to be invisible?</p>

<p>For the next two chapters we will discuss 'Christian eschatology,' the doctrine of the end of things - the future. It is extremely hazardous to try to explain what happened to the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus, even with the description of the event recorded three times in Scripture. How much more difficult to discuss the possibility of how things may be in the future in a world we cannot see! All we can do is to show that many elements of Christian eschatology are not necessarily in contradiction with some aspects of modern views of space. What evidence do we have? The Resurrection of Christ is a recorded Biblical event which points to what the Apostles' Creed calls belief in 'the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.' </p>

<p>Psychologists have sometimes referred to this wishful thought of eternal life as 'pie in the sky bye and bye.' However unlikely this possibility may seem from a scientific point of view, if the Bible has recorded the facts correctly concerning Jesus Christ - and if he really is the Son of God - then we are faced with the possibility that the universe really works in much the way as has been outlined in Scripture. If the Bible is right, we have to look not only for 'pie in the sky,' but also for 'heat in the deep.'</p>

<p>One difficulty is that people have argued that heaven is not so much a place as a state. Of course this is just a guess, the basis of which seems to be that the 'resurrection body' of persons will be 'spiritual' rather than physical. Paul argues that we are resurrected into a 'spiritual body' (1 Corinthians 15:44), which suggests to some that the body is immaterial. </p>

<p>In this same letter to the Corinthians, however, Paul was speaking about the 
Israelites in the wilderness who 'all ate the same spiritual food and all drank 
the same spiritual drink' (I Corinthians 10:3, 4), although in the RSV we find 
that the word 'supernatural' has been substituted for 'spiritual' because the 
translators feared misunderstanding; but the translators did not speak of a 
'supernatural body.' Paul seems to have thought that the 'spiritual bread' from 
heaven (from the UFO) and the 'spiritual body' of the resurrection were similar. 
Perhaps the words heavenly body and heavenly bread would better express Paul's 
idea - both were made of a 'heavenly substance,' whatever that might be. </p>

<p>Jesus said that in the resurrection we become as angels. It is quite clear 
from the Resurrection appearances that Jesus did not seem to have an ordinary 
body. But it was a body his disciples could touch, just as angels seem to be 
substantial beings. In an age in which mass and energy are transferable, perhaps 
this debate is not too crucial. But it seems that we can expect our resurrection 
bodies - if we want to trust the Biblical view of eternal life, which I do - to 
occupy some space somewhere. Therefore, it is appropriate to ask the question: 
Where is heaven?</p>

<p>If the first chapters in this book have bordered on science fiction, then the following chapters undoubtedly move almost without fear into something that reads very much like science fiction. What follows is not necessarily true, but I do believe that the next two chapters may help to set our minds free from the somewhat depressing agnosticism we now find ourselves in when we even begin to entertain the idea that we might live eternally - as part of God's plan. We have been almost too discouraged to go on looking for a sign that God really does have eternal plans for us. If the next two chapters serve to show that the Biblical idea of the future - of the resurrection of the body into some heavenly existence - may be scientifically possible, then I will feel that they have served their purpose: to set men's minds free to entertain a lively hope in the gospel.</p>

<p>To be consistent with the method we have employed in evaluating the Biblical material up to the present time, to ask the question 'Where is heaven?' is also to ask the question, 'Where do flying saucers come from?' The present concensus of most writers is that since there are perhaps millions of inhabitable planets in the universe, flying saucers probably come from one such planet, and the nearer to earth the better. A Time magazine essay, 'A Fresh Look at Flying Saucers,' points out how difficult longdistance space travel becomes. 'Even the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is 4.3 light-years away. And because presumably no spaceship - or any matter - can travel at or beyond the velocity of light, which is the universal speed limit according to the Einstein theory of relativity, it would take considerably longer than 4.3 light-years to reach the earth from its nearest stellar neighbor. At the 17,500 m.p.h. that astronauts travel, it would take nearly 170,000 years.' (3)</p>

<p>We are still in the stone age of space travel, so that it is probably quite misleading to compare the speed of our spaceships with those of beings who are really advanced in space travel. But Time's essay raises an important question: What does Einstein's theory of relativity have to do with space travel, and what sort of possibilities does the theory contain concerning our search for heaven? Although I am no authority on relativity, I will try to examine some of the issues.</p>

<p>One of the basic assumptions of Einstein and Eddington and others who have developed the general 'theory of relativity' is that space, time, and gravitation are interdependent, not independent. (4) In fact, gravitation came to be understood as either a property of space, or of matter which permeated and influenced all space. Thus any point particle is in effect under the influence of the whole universe. Furthermore, non-Euclidean geometry had been developed, and it was suggested that space may not be 'straight' or 'flat,' but rather curved, and that all objects traveling in space follow a curved path.</p>

<p>Einstein predicted that the gravitation of the universe would even deflect light rays, and this was later experimentally verified. He was led to conclude that the universe might be 'finite, but unbounded,' meaning that although there is no physical boundary to the universe, the gravitational field of the universe would act as a 'fence,' so that any point particle traveling in space - even a ray of light -would be bent in an arc and would never escape a certain volume or area of space. Thus the force of gravitation would cause our usable space to be finite. Matter in space is something like a dog on a leash, tied to a stake. The dog can wander in a circle around the stake - his world does not appear to be bounded, but it is finite. He is limited by the leash (force of gravitation) which pulls him in toward the center stake.</p>

<p>Another aspect of Einstein's thinking, which has been verified to some extent by experimental observation, is that any mass which is accelerated takes on an additional apparent mass, and as the mass approaches the speed of light, this increase in apparent mass becomes greater. This is one of the reasons scientists were led to conclude that it would be impossible to accelerate any mass - including a spaceship - to a velocity which would equal or exceed the velocity of light.</p>

<p>Since gravity provides resistance to acceleration, we have to have rockets to send our spaceships into orbit. The rockets counteract the resisting force of gravity. As we have already pointed out, however, many of the flying-saucer reports suggest that saucer activity is so unusual that some have come to the conclusion that the beings who developed the saucers have somehow developed a technology which has set them free from the effects of gravity. Major Donald E. Keyhoe, in his book The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, devotes a full chapter to the idea of an anti-gravitational field. (5) He points out that saucers have been seen to make right-angled turns at high speeds, and to accelerate from a velocity of zero to eighteen thousand miles an hour almost instantly. Saucers have apparently on occasion caused electromagnetic interference, such as shorting out the electrical systems of automobiles. </p>

<p>We assume that saucers have some kind of propulsion system, and yet they usually make no noise. These are some of the reasons that have led men such as Keyhoe, Edwards, and Vallee to conclude that saucers are propelled by generating some kind of anti-gravitational field or shield. Whether or not the term anti-gravitational is the best term to describe the phenomenon is not clear. But in any case, we have to ask the question: If the civilization behind the saucers has found a means to escape the effect of gravity, what does this mean?</p>

<p>We have mentioned that according to Einstein our visible universe is 'finite, but unbounded.' Our universe is finite to us because we are bound to our universe by gravitation like a dog tethered to a stick. If we were to be set free from the effects of gravity, however, I can see no reason why we would not be free to move beyond our universe into a new space, much as if a dog had been cut free from his tether. Scientists have been discussing the possible existence of 'antimatter'; there is no logical reason why only one type of matter could exist. Some material substance might exist outside our universe if it were somehow unaffected by the gravitational field of our universe. </p>

<p>It might be possible for several universes to coexist, much as several boats sail the ocean, provided that each universe has a different type of gravitational system so that none are attracted toward any others. If gravity is the property of the curvature of space, it might be possible for several universes to coexist separately, provided they were governed by different spatial curvatures. But this still leaves us with the problem that since according to the relativity theory the speed of light is the universal speed limit, it would take millions of years traveling at the speed of light to reach any possible universe outside our own. Perhaps, however, since our concepts of relativity are still being explored by science, there is a yet undiscovered way to overcome this 'speed limit.' Then almost infinite speeds might become possible.</p>

<p>This is of course speculation, but I do believe the present concepts of space, cosmology, and the whole question of the nature of the universe are so open that we do have the freedom to speculate in this way; however uncertain our conclusions, we can still explore the Biblical framework without having to feel intellectually guilty about doing so. Although science has made fantastic discoveries about the universe, many of these discoveries have simply opened brand-new fields which need to be explored.</p>

<p>If the theory of relativity permits us to imagine heaven as a universe separate from and beyond our own universe, this is by no means the only possible solution to the problem, and I will now suggest another. Our own space may be curved, either in a negative or positive direction, or it may have a zero curvature. Scientists have not decided which type of curvature is characteristic of our own universe, but given the idea that our space is curved, it is interesting to consider concepts in mathematical space topology such as Jordan's Curve Theorem which states in effect 'that there are an inside and an outside of a simple closed curve in a plane.' (6) This idea seems to imply that if our universe is similar to a closed curve, then there might be an 'inside' and an 'outside' universe coexisting in the same space with our own universe. We are led to ask the question: Would it be possible for universes of different spatial curvatures to coexist in the same space?</p>

<p>Could you move from one universe to another provided you understood the spatial curvature, or gravitational formula for each space?</p>

<p>This reads like science fiction, but it is interesting to examine one flying-saucer report recorded by Keyhoe. He points out that there seem to be at least two types of UFOs: the 'flying-saucer' type, and a cigar-shaped 'mother ship' into which flying saucers have been seen to fly. Keyhoe records this report by Captain James Howard and the crew of a BO AC air liner:</p>

<p>As Captain Howard was checking his arrival time, a dark object appeared a few miles to the left. Flying parallel to the plane, it was clearly visible in the fight from the setting sun. Manoeuvring around this mysterious craft were several small, round objects. For a few moments Captain Howard and his co-pilot, First Officer Lee Boyd, watched in amazement. Until then Howard had been sceptical of flying-saucer reports, and Boyd had been only half convinced.</p>

<p>The small saucers appeared to be flying in and out of the larger ship, though the pilots could not be sure.</p>

<p>Suddenly the mother-ship changed its position, making it appear to change shape, just as an aeroplane, seen from different angles, assumes varying shapes.</p>

<p>Both Captain Howard and Boyd were convinced that the objects were solid. And from the way the six small UFOs manoeuvred, circling and apparently boarding the mother ship, they were obviously under intelligent control.</p>

<p>Calling Goose Bay Air Force Base, Boyd reported the strange formation. Within seconds two U.S. Sabrejet fighters were scrambled to meet the Centaurus.</p>

<p>By now all the crew and some of the passengers had seen the saucer formation. Had this been a cargo flight, Captain Howard might have risked a closer approach. But with the lives of the crew and fifty-one passengers to consider, he decided against it.</p>

<p>The mother-ship and its smaller saucers were still flying parallel to the Centaurus when one of the Sabrejet pilots radioed the airliner from a point twenty miles away. The saucers, Captain Howard told him, were still pacing his plane.</p>

<p>'I'll be there in two or three minutes,' the Air Force pilot answered.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing occurred.</p>

<p>Quickly the six smaller craft merged with the mother-ship. Accelerating at tremendous speed, the larger machine vanished in a matter of seconds? (7)</p>

<p>It is possible to conclude with Keyhoe and the pilots that the dark object was a mother ship and that it disappeared quickly because a gravity-free spaceship would have the property of extremely rapid acceleration. But given the idea of the 'curvature' of space, and of an 'inside' and 'outside' universe, it would be possible to speculate that the so-called mothership into which the saucers flew was in fact a bend or warp in the space-thru continuum, some kind of space 'tunnel' from the 'middle' universe to either the 'inside' or 'outside' universe. One can well wonder why the saucers seemed to be bright while the mother ship was 'dark.' Were they made of different material, or was the mother ship in fact not a ship, not material, but rather some kind of strange void? </p>

<p>This dark object appeared to change shape. Is this because the 'mother ship' changed position as Keyhoe suggested, or might this have been the natural result of stress placed on the space 'tunnel' due to the changing position of the planets in our solar system, causing a variation in the density of the gravitational field? Keyhoe reports that the mother ship appeared to accelerate very rapidly, and of course this is possible. But if the space tunnel were suddenly to close, it would probably close like a camera shutter, giving the appearance of an object moving rapidly away, and finally diminishing to a point. Thus given the idea of the curvature of space, and the fact that space and gravitation are interdependent, it is possible to conjecture that more than one universe might coexist in the same space, and if you knew how to control gravity, you might also know how to control your space and move from one spatial curvature to another.</p>

<p>Whether the pilots in the BOAC liner saw the saucers disappear into a mother ship, or into some sort of space tunnel leading to another invisible universe right in the midst of us, I do not know. But given the various cosmological possibilities which seem to be inherent within the general theory of relativity, I think that the idea of the space tunnel cannot be ruled out immediately on theoretical grounds. On the basis of the report recorded by Keyhoe, I believe that a space tunnel is a possible interpretation of what was observed. It is easier, \ think, to believe Key-hoe's interpretation, that the dark object was a mother ship. But it would be a mistake at this point in our understanding of cosmology, or in our understanding of the point of origin of flying saucers, to rule out any possibility before more evidence is available. (8)</p>

<p>UFOs have been seen to change shape, going through something like a 'folding' process, and to disappear so rapidly that they have been described as going 'out like a light.' (9) Since UFOs and beings associated with them apparently have unusual control over gravity (in the Bible, everything from the parting of the Red Sea, or the Jordan River, to Jesus' walking on water) and since modern science has suggested that gravitational forces may be linked with curvatures of space, we must remain flexible in regard to the problem of where UFOs originate. It is important to realize that in the past half-century concepts of space have become much more fluid, much more open than those accepted by science before 1900. It is perhaps best at this point to remain undecided about the truth value of my 'space tunnel' interpretation. It does not seem too probable, but scientific concepts seem to be fluid enough that we cannot automatically rule it out. In this 'undecided' frame of mind let us examine some of the Biblical concepts of the nature and location of heaven.</p>

<p><b>The 'Spirit Of God' And The 'Opening Of The Heavens'</b></p>

<p>When Jesus was baptized, he saw 'the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him' (Matthew 3:16). Where did this UFO come from, according to the Biblical account? After Jesus was baptized, 'the heavens were opened' and the Spirit seems to have descended from this 'opening.' This idea of an 'opening' represents an example of the 'mythological' expression of the Biblical cosmology against which Bishop Robinson and others have written. The 'opening' suggests that in our 'three-decker universe' 'a door' leads from our world below to the world above where the angels live in heaven. In the first chapter of Genesis we read that God created 'a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters' (Genesis 1:6). The early Biblical people seem to have believed that there was something like a glass sheet which held water up in heaven (apparently outer space was thought to be mostly water); when rain was needed, various doors were opened in heaven to let the rain come down. Thus when the great flood came upon Noah, we read that 'on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened' (Genesis 7:11).</p>

<p>We have to admit that there is here a primitive cosmology, and certainly something like it may have prevailed during the whole Biblical period. But the idea which the 'firmament' expresses may be useful, if somewhat modified, in order to understand our own relation to heaven, Our visible universe seems to be essentially homogeneous and created. It seems unlikely that no matter how far one traveled into outer space, one would find heaven. But there may be something like a 'glass sheet' which separates our created universe from both 'heaven' and 'hell.' </p>

<p>I am suggesting that by using the concepts of the curvature of space in Einstein's universe, there may be something like a 'three-decker universe.' In Robinson's 'three-decker universe' heaven is simply the 'third story' on a house, the earth is the second story, and hell is the first (or the cellar) each stacked one on the other; this may have represented the primitive Biblical view, as Bultmann, Robinson, and others have argued. But what about a three-decker universe in which the stories are not so much vertical to each other as horizontal to each other? </p>

<p>The universes are separated by 'walls' rather than by floors and ceilings, although this analogy is not adequate, because heaven, hell, and our visible universe may in fact occupy a 'one-room house,' but by means of a variation in the curvature of space, whether positive, negative, or zero, we are able to have three universes occupy the same volume of space. One would perhaps move from one universe to the other by 'bending space' so that an opening would be made.</p>

<p>Keyhoe, as we have seen in his Flying Saucer Conspiracy, has shown that UFOs of the saucer type have been seen to fly in and out of some dark object which we have suggested was a 'space tunnel.' If those present at the baptism of Jesus saw the 'Spirit of God' (the bright cloud) emerge from some dark opening above, then perhaps we have here the link between our world and the next. This of course stretches scientific knowledge, proper Biblical exegesis, and the imagination to a limit which perhaps cannot be justified, but it is a useful model by which further to examine Biblical thought. One interesting fact about the use of the Greek word for opening is that it refers to opening places which otherwise would be closed to man. (10)</p>

<p>When Stephen was about to be stoned, he 'gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God'" (Acts 7:55,56). The reference to God's 'glory' might indicate the presence of a 'bright cloud' type of UFO, and we find Stephen apparently seeing in some kind of vision the 'opening' or bending back of space. None of the other persons present seems to have had this vision, which shares something of the apocalyptic character of the Revelation of John. Whether the experience of Stephen was psychological, physical, a combination of both, or neither is difficult to say. But it is interesting that Stephen seems to have sensed that God was present as if he were in the 'next room,' so to speak. The door to the next room was momentarily opened to him.</p>

<p>Why did Stephen 'gaze into heaven'? The passage says that Stephen, 'full of 
the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven' (Acts 7:55). The Holy Spirit in the Bible is 
usually invisible, but nevertheless present to each person. The Holy Spirit 
seems to be an invisible power from another universe which is right in the midst 
of our universe. At Pentecost the disciples 'were all together in one place. And 
suddenly a sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled 
all the house where they were sitting. ... And they were all filled with the 
Holy Spirit' (Acts 2:1-4). </p>

<p>I will not even begin to attempt to explain what happened at Pentecost, but 
one gains the impression that the Holy Spirit seems to have 'broken through' the 
space of the room where the disciples were gathered. The 'breakthrough' was 
reported to have caused a physical disturbance, 'like the rush of a mighty 
wind,' an effect that might result from the 'bending' or 'opening' of space. 
When the Holy Spirit came upon Stephen, he did not gaze 'up' to heaven; he gazed 
'into' heaven, as if it were in the next room. Jesus did not ascend 'up' to 
heaven; he ascended 'into' heaven, to the 'inner sanctuary' of the presence of 
God. Perhaps the use of the preposition 'into' is more important than we have 
realized in expressing the location of heaven.</p>

<p>On another occasion the Apostle Peter fell into some sort of trance, and he 'saw the heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth. In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.' (Acts 10:11,12). Peter was told that he should kill and eat the contents of the sheet-like UFO which was lowered in front of him. Peter, a Jew, had never eaten unclean food, and he was told to eat to prepare him for his meeting with the Gentile Cornelius, who had heard an angel in a vision tell him to send for Peter. Both Peter and Cornelius reacted as if they made contact with a strange world which was somehow in their midst, but was usually invisible.</p>

<p><b>The Kingdom Of God Is In The Midst Of You'</b></p>

<p>On one occasion Jesus told his disciples, 'where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them' (Matthew 18:20); how could Christ be present to the disciples, yet invisible? Although it is not clear what happened, Luke records that Jesus was led by the villagers of Nazareth 'to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. But passing through the midst of them he went away' (Luke 4:29, 30). </p>

<p>This passage implies that Jesus passed through their midst without effort. One of the more debated passages in Scripture is the answer Jesus gave to the Pharisees concerning the coming of the kingdom of God. Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; nor will they say, "Lo, here it is!" or "There!" for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you"' (Luke 17:20,21).</p>

<p>The first question must be, What is meant by the phrase the kingdom of God? It must be remembered that Matthew almost never uses the phrase the kingdom of God; rather, he speaks of the equivalent kingdom of heaven. Luke, on the other hand, almost always speaks of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God (or heaven) would necessarily be a place where God reigned. Would this be on earth or in heaven, or both? It is clear from the teaching of Jesus that there is a distinction between heaven and earth. In the 'Lord's Prayer' we read 'thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven' (Matthew 6:10). The Jews believed that indeed someday the kingdom of heaven would come to earth, and it was this belief which motivated the question the Pharisees raised concerning the coming of the kingdom. </p>

<p>The answer Jesus gave can be given a number of interpretations:</p>

<p>The kingdom might be 'in the midst of you' in the sense that God is concerned with man's heart or mind, and he seeks to come into the 'midst' of the life of every person. Thus the idea of the 'kingdom' is given a spiritual or mental interpretation. But this interpretation is unsatisfactory because Jesus, knowing his opinion of the Pharisees, would not have been likely to tell them that the kingdom was within them. One would not expect the kingdom to be found in the minds of the hypocritical Pharisees.</p>

<p>The generally more acceptable interpretation is that Jesus was referring to himself. He was standing 'in the midst' of the Pharisees, and the kingdom of God was embodied in Jesus. When Jesus says that the kingdom is not coming with 'signs to be observed,' he could have been referring to the fact that in the coming of Christ the power of God was underplayed; Jesus here acknowledges his 'undercover agent' role which had been defined in the scenes in the wilderness during his temptations. The kingdom was hidden in an innocent-looking carpenter's son, standing in the midst of them. John the Baptist came preaching that 'the kingdom of heaven is at hand' (Matthew 3:2), which was the Biblical way of pointing to the coming of Christ. </p>

<p>The main difficulty with saying that the kingdom was fully present in Christ is that Luke, after recording this incident with the Pharisees, moves on to describe an apocalyptic passage which Jesus relates to his disciples, and this passage speaks more directly to the question the Pharisees raised. Jesus says, 'For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side of the other, so will the Son of man be in his day' (Luke 17:24). Jesus taught that some aspect of the kingdom will be consummated in the future. </p>

<p>He suggests that the Son of Man (i.e., himself) will someday in the future return with the suddenness and brightness of lightning flashing across the sky. In the final chapter we shall deal with the 'second coming of Christ,' but it is important to notice that the early Church believed that someday Christ would return with a power even greater than that wielded by Moses. Thus for Jesus to say to the Pharisees that the kingdom is already - now - in the midst of them in its most powerful aspect is not quite true to much of the Biblical material.</p>

<p>The third alternative is to distinguish between the kingdom of God on earth and the kingdom of God in heaven. The kingdom of God in heaven is fully obedient to the will of God, which is why we are to pray that God's will may be done on earth as it is done in heaven. If when Jesus answered the Pharisees he was referring to the kingdom of God in heaven, and if there is some validity in my speculation that Einstein's curvature of space provides the clue to the 'place' where heaven is, then perhaps Jesus meant quite literally that the kingdom of God or of heaven is 'in the midst of us, although it is invisible. Heaven may be an entirely different universe right in the midst of us.</p>

<p>From an exegetical, and also from a scientific, point of view I may be stretching the implications of the ideas of 'in the midst of you' and 'the curvature of space.' But if we are to take the idea of heaven seriously, then we have to attempt to reconcile two difficult facts: 'the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal' (II Corinthians 4:18); and just as angels seem to by physical, and as the resurrection body of Christ seemed to be physical, it would seem to follow that we need a 'resurrection universe' which is invisible and yet allows for bodily existence. The Bible comes close to saying that this invisible universe is in the midst of us, invisible due to its different spatial curvature.</p>

<p><b>The Locked Rooms And The Space Tunnel</b></p>

<p>On at least two occasions after his Resurrection Jesus came and stood in the midst of the disciples when the doors of the room had been shut, and presumably locked, 'for fear of the Jews' (John 20:19). On the first occasion Thomas was not with the disciples, but 'eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said "Peace be with you." Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but believing." Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!" Jesus said to him, 'Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe"' (John 20:26-29).</p>

<p>The disciples seemed to have had no explanation of how Jesus could have come 
and stood in the midst of them while the door was closed. Scholars have 
sometimes suggested that the resurrection body of Christ was able to go through 
closed doors, which perhaps it could, but the disciples did not report 'seeing' 
his body somehow move through a closed door. The Gospel of John simply says, 
'Jesus came.' It strikes one as peculiar that the body of Jesus could move 
through a door and yet be touched by Thomas, as the Gospel reports in the same 
sequence. </p>

<p>If we can suppose, however, that we live in the 'midst' of an invisible 
spatially curved resurrection universe, then perhaps Jesus 'came' through a 
'space tunnel' into the room where the disciples were gathered with the door 
locked. The implication would then seem to follow that Jesus did not need a UFO 
or 'space cloud' to take him to heaven, but rather that the Ascension was a 
special event staged for the benefit of the disciples to let them know that 
there was something 'final' about the way Jesus left on this occasion.</p>

<p>When Jesus appeared to Mary, he said to her, 'Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God' (John 20:17). Later Jesus invited the disciples to touch him, so that it seems strange that Jesus would have forbidden Mary to 'hold' him, although he may have meant, 'Do not detain me.' But Jesus is reported to have said that he was preparing to ascend to his Father, when in fact the Ascension did not take place for some forty days. </p>

<p>On the basis of the resurrection appearances of Jesus one could argue that Jesus actually 'moved back and forth' between our world and the resurrection world for the 'forty-day' period, appearing to the disciples for short periods of time and then 'ascending' or returning to the resurrection world. Jesus was seen to ascend on only one occasion, which was his final appearance except for his brief visit to Paul on the Damascus Road. If we can suppose that there is an invisible resurrection universe in the midst of us, then we have a possible explanation of the unusual features of the resurrection appearances of Christ.</p>

<p>There are at least two other occasions reported in the Bible which, while not duplicating the 'closed door' resurrection appearances of Christ, may be related to them. On one occasion the apostles were being kept in a guarded prison, and an angel came and set them free. When the officers came for their prisoners, they said they found 'the sentries standing at the doors, but when we opened it we found no one inside' (Acts 5:23). The disciples were found teaching in the Temple.</p>

<p>On a second occasion Peter was imprisoned, and 'was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison; and behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." And the chains fell off his hands' (Acts 12:6,7). Peter dressed, thinking all the while that he must be dreaming. 'When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him' (Acts 12:10,11). Peter was on his own, standing alone in a street in the middle of the night. He finally came to his senses and went his way.</p>

<p>One cannot help wondering how the angel and Peter could get by the sentries undetected, but one also wonders how the angel entered the prison. We read that the iron gate opened to let Peter and the angel out of the prison. Did the angel close the gate when he came in, or did he get in some other way? Did he come in through a space tunnel from the resurrection universe?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is unfounded speculation, but it appears that if we are going to explain much of the Biblical data, the idea of an invisible resurrection universe in the midst of us is an extremely useful idea by which to interpret, or at least make some sense of, much of the Biblical material.</p>

<p><b>'In My Father's House Are Many Rooms'</b></p>

<p>There is one aspect of the Biblical view of space which does not directly support our thesis concerning a 'resurrection universe' in the midst of us. The Jewish temple provided the 'model' by which the Hebrews understood the universe; in fact, the temple provided a microcosmic model of the universe, including heaven and hell. Each part of the temple, the design of which was apparently dictated by an angel, was symbolic of some part of the 'house' of God, that is, of God's universe. Thus we read in the Gospel of John that in the words of Jesus, 'In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also' (John 14:2,3).</p>

<p>To describe the universe as composed of 'rooms' or 'compartments' which are spatially separated by 'walls' is not quite consistent with my suggestion that two 'rooms' or universes occupy the same space. The Bible suggests that we can move from one universe to another, or one room to another, through 'doors.' The book of Revelation, which is part of the Johannine material, is filled with symbolism related to the Jewish temple. Thus when we read how John received the Apocalypse we discover, 'After this I looked, and lo, in heaven an open door! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up hither, and I will show you what must take place after this." At once I was in the Spirit, and lo, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne" (Revelation 4:1-2). </p>

<p>When we read in the passages concerning the baptism of Jesus that the Spirit of God descended after the heavens had 'opened,' we have again an illustration of the way in which the Biblical world view included a many-roomed universe. Heaven was apparently 'above' and one entered it by doors. The temple could never provide an adequate model for a universe in which several 'universes' coexist one inside the other, for the temple is only three-dimensional, whereas Einstein's universe and related models are more complex.</p>

<p>If one insists on taking the idea of the Jewish temple as a precise model of the universe, one has to assume that space is square, and thus the earth would have 'four corners,' as would a room in the temple. This is not a useful approach to the problem. But I do not want completely to abandon the idea that the temple may indeed tell us something useful about our universe, and about the relation between our universe, the resurrection world, and hell. These worlds seem to be separated by 'walls' of some sort, and spatial curvatures according to modern science form 'natural' walls. </p>

<p>Jesus told of the fact that our status in the next world, whether in heaven or in hell, depends on our deeds in this life. He spoke of a rich man who refused to feed the poor man Lazarus. Both died, the rich man going to Hades, and Lazarus to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man called to Abraham for help, but help could not be given, among other reasons, because 'besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us' (Luke 16:26).</p>

<p>The word chasm is used here by Luke, and this is the only occasion on which the word is used in the whole New Testament. The Greek word quite literally means 'a yawning'; (11) a 'yawning' or bending of space so that it is impossible to move from one space to another, suggests that the 'rooms' in God's 'house' are separated by something like a bending or yawning or curvature of space.</p>

<p>We must keep in mind the extreme hazards of trying to give a factual interpretation of Biblical material which is symbolic in nature. Should one apply this symbolism to modern theories of space, which are by no means universally accepted among scientists and may be radically revised in the future? I do not know. But I do believe that the relation between the Biblical view of space and our modern views of space is extremely open. To speak, as Bishop Robinson does, about the primitive Biblical three-decker universe does not begin to explore the delicate aspects of the Biblical view of space. Our understanding of space has changed so radically in the past fifty years that it is difficult for anyone except scientific and mathematical specialists to understand what the modern views of space are.</p>

<p>We should be prepared to tolerate a less than perfect spatial 'model' which may have been used by beings from another world who seem to have helped shape the Biblical view of space. If we allow ourselves to be a little 'liberal' in our interpretation of the Biblical cosmology, and if we are also a little 'liberal' in our interpretation of our modern cosmologies - that is, if we admit that the situation is extremely open - then I cannot see how the 'demythologizers' can be so certain that the Biblical world view and our modern world view do not, and never will, fit together, and that as a consequence it is in Bishop Robinson's opinion 'intellectually dishonest' for a Christian even to go on hoping that Jesus really was 'lifted up' into space by some sort of UFO - a space cloud - or that there may really be an invisible heaven and hell. </p>

<p>Robinson can argue that many of my speculations are 'highly improbable,' perhaps ridiculous, but we are a long way from the point where we can say that the whole Biblical way of thinking about space is impossible - which is what Robinson is in effect saying. It would be a mistake to take everything the Bible says about space literally, but I believe it would also be a mistake to suppose that the Bible tells us nothing true or important concerning space.</p>
