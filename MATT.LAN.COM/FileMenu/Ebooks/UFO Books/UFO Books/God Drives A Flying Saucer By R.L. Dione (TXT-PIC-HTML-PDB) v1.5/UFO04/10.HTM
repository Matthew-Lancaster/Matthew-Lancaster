<p>Man, in his long struggle out of the black pit of ignorance, finds himself today on the edge of enlightenment, restrained only by the last vestiges of superstition. He still believes in miracles, but no longer does he believe that insanity is caused by demons or that witches are agents of the devil. No longer is walking under ladders and breaking mirrors considered bad luck; only certain old maids and fortunetellers still believe such hokum. This is progress. But our heritage of superstition, augmented by a misinterpretation of the Bible, blocks our view of truth, enslaving us in the never-never land of shadowy metaphysics.</p>

<p>The occult rules supreme, unchallenged as long as we admit the possibility of effect without cause - as long as we admit and submit to the myth of miracles. Who of sound mind and judgment can lift his face to heaven with adoration for a supernatural god while at the same time ridiculing the voodoo witch doctor who mumbles incantations against his enemies? Inconsistency and paradox are the dead-end avenues of such thinking, if thinking it can be called. For it is completely illogical to admit the existence of anything supernatural (effect without cause) and then limit the scope of this power to include only the work of God.</p>

<p>Once we accept the fact that miracles, like magicians' illusions, defy no laws of nature, we will find it easier to embrace the Christian religion; for then we must know that the miracles of the Bible and the miracle of Fatima were performed, not by magic but through use of super-technological devices in the hands of super-technological beings. And knowing this, knowing that the Bible, stripped of its aura of mysticism, is after all, the word of God, we must see that the scriptures are a textbook of God's relationship to man. In its pages God reveals all. He gives man moral standards. He tells him how to enjoy the life He gave him. He even tells how man came into existence on the earth and how this earthly existence will end. And there can be no doubt that God tells man how to achieve immortality.</p>

<p>A reading of Genesis in this light makes it impressively clear that man on the earth represents an experiment of colossal nature: an experiment which in all probability is not unique in the solar system or even in our galaxy. Consider, for example, the satellites of Mars which many astronomers believe to be artificial. And what of the outermost satellite of Jupiter, which orbits counter to the inner eight? Add to this the recently discovered radio signals from outer space which, because of their precise time intervals, seem to be intelligently controlled, and we have significant evidence that life is not unique to earth. In fact, if these space signals are, as some astronomers believe, navigational beacons, then it is indeed certain that the entire Milky Way galaxy is populated with intelligent life forms. But what is more important is that these life forms are perhaps millions of years ahead of us on the evolutionary scale. As a matter of fact, since it is impossible to theorize a beginning in time, we might even conclude that some life forms (God's society in particular) have always existed - with no beginning.</p>

<p>If our existence here on earth represents an experiment, then, we must ask, what is the purpose? What exactly does God want of us? As mentioned earlier, faulty and mystical interpretations of the Bible have beclouded God's real purpose (which, as we shall see, is the way God wants it). Most of us believe that God wants us to live a good life and to believe in Him, for which He will in the end reward us with life everlasting. But this does not answer the question (even if one believes God to be supernatural). The question is. What does God get out of it? Theologians always answer this question with gibberish which ultimately translates as We don't know.</p>

<p>But there is an answer. To find it, we need only project our own civilization a few thousand years into the future. Imagine the monotony when scientific achievements have improved man's living conditions to the point of perfection. The challenge in life, as well as the beauty, is found in the triumph over obstacles. When all obstacles have been overcome, man will either deteriorate or do as God and His saucerians have done: create a civilization of his own and play god.</p>

<p>In the context of eternal time the culture on earth today must be considered sub-primitive; and yet, even in this state, we find evidence of the deterioration that results when life becomes too easy. When the mind is not occupied by the performance of productive labor, it turns to other, less desirable occupations: it reaches for kicks, through drugs or other flirtations with unacceptable behavior. There can be no doubt that science and technological progress are responsible for this state of affairs, and there can be no doubt that the cure, if any, must come from science. For technology, one way or the other, must fill the gap left in the wake of its achievements. Either man must be challenged or he must be entertained.</p>

<p>What could be more entertaining than to watch a new civilization grow? And to live the lives of its members by means of thought-transmission devices would be the ultimate in diversion. And further, to guide the thinking and the activities of the subjects in the experiment would give more satisfaction than any man achieves today by creating great works of art.</p>

<p>But God is experienced and intelligent. He realizes that even this game can become monotonous; therefore He allows us a large measure of free will in order that members of His society (guardian angels) cannot anticipate what men will do. To insure this free will God_has made rules for His angels. In Job Chapter 33 God reveals two of these rules. The first is put concisely: "God speaketh once, and repeateth not the self same thing the second time." And the second is: "By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds: then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn. That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from pride. [Is it any wonder that in this little game God does not want man to be proud?] ... Rescuing his soul from corruption; and his life from passing to the sword ... Behold, all these things God worketh three times within every one." So, by the word of God himself, we see that He never repeats the same message - not because He doesn't care to take the time, but because He (or they) find it more exciting to leave us with that certain amount of free will. One set of electromagnetic instructions from the saucerians probably does not insure that they will be carried out, just as a post-hypnotic suggestion repeated but once is not as effective as one repeated several times. The restriction of three messages to a customer is obviously imposed for the same reason: the game would be spoiled by too much interference.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that messages are transmitted only when the subjects are asleep. If messages were received by conscious subjects, the subjects might become aware of the foreign nature of the contact, and eventually God's game would be disclosed. However, people who report having religious revelations may in fact have been contacted while they were awake. Such exceptions to the rule are attested to by the long list of prophets in Christendom who have had visions while awake. And of course there is Fatima. </p>

<p>Other diversions are inherent in the nature of this game God plays: tests to determine what method or methods will develop the best civilizations would be interesting. Experiments with germs and viruses to determine the subjects' ability to cope with them would also prove fascinating. And although it is difficult to believe that beings as advanced as God and His saucerians find pleasure in such activities, the evidence that in their game of hide-and-seek they like to leave clues is overwhelmingly conclusive. They flirt with discovery. The game is reminiscent of a child darting in and out of range of a rotating lawn sprinkler, challenging the water to catch him.</p>

<p>Perhaps, because challenge adds zest to the game, God tells us that we will be instructed but three times in our lives and that such instruction will come only when we sleep; certainly there can be no useful purpose in our having this information. To the student of the Bible, information of this sort (having nothing to do with instructions for right living) is readily recognized as the chief ingredient of God's word. As a matter of fact, a conservative estimate would be that over half the material in the Bible deals with hints at God's true nature and identity. The rest of the Bible, strangely enough, concerns God's obvious preoccupation with what appear to be feelings of insecurity. He brags He cajoles and He even threatens us in an attempt to win our faith in Him and our love for Him. We may conclude that either He is starved for love and respect or He is engaged in some sort of contest - perhaps with gods of other galaxies.</p>

<p>If the father of a family on earth were to demand love and respect the way that God does of His family, he would be considered a psychopath; for in our concept of love, the emotion cannot be commanded, it must be earned. (Knowledge of this may have been one of God's reasons for dispatching Jesus.) One who demands love usually receives in its place either hatred or pity. Likewise, in our society a braggart can expect either scorn or, from those who are understanding, pity. Anyone who doubts that God is a braggart has never read the Bible. For starters, I refer him to Job, Chapter 25.</p>

<p>So it appears that life in a super-technological society (heaven) may not be, as advertised, a bed of roses, for we see that at least two characteristics of God's society are pitiable. If we survive another few thousand years, perhaps we too will find ourselves begging for love - not much caring from whence it comes and perhaps also - finding a certain measure of fulfillment in boasting of our accomplishments, even to lesser beings. Such may well be the destiny of a society which masters nature. For then, when Nature is brought to her knees, love, hate, self-respect and yes, even mercy - all these must be artificially induced; all these, if they are to be experienced at all, must be experienced through games. The nature of perfection dictates that such must be the case. For it is obvious that in a perfect society no man can incur the hatred of another, for no man has something another would want. No man in such a sterile society would ever misunderstand even the emotions of another, much less another's ideas. With a mind-reading machine and a brain-manipulating device, our perfect society would all think as one; and as a consequence individuality (which encompasses love and self-respect) would dissolve in a quagmire of monotony.</p>

<p>As part of the game, God has told us not only how we came into being but also how we will end. If not for personal satisfaction, then for what other reason does He tell us that when the end comes, the sun will darken and the moon will turn red? And He says there will be havoc on earth and that the stars will disappear from heaven on that day when Jesus comes again, riding his cloud with "great power." And the earth and all upon it will perish in flames, and even the air will be burned. Why? Why tell us how it will be and then in the next breath tell us that Jesus will come "like a thief in the night"? What purpose can it serve to tell us the circumstances of the last days but then assure us that it will happen when we least expect it? God obviously gets carried away His games. </p>

<p>Regardless of the rules of the game, perhaps the most important question of all, from our point of view, is, When does an experiment of this nature end, and how? Again, putting ourselves in the position of the experimenters, we can visualize several conditions sufficient to require termination of operations. For instance, if our subjects' scientific achievements were to grow out of proportion to their ethical and moral maturity; if they were to develop nuclear devices which would threaten our superiority and therefore our control over them, we might then wish to end the experiment. If not, we might at least consider a more direct approach in controlling their destiny (although we should find this much less entertaining).</p>

<p>Another reason for terminating such an experiment would be that our subjects with their newly developed ability to travel to other planets might inadvertently interrupt the progress of similar experiments in other worlds.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out that progress here on earth has brought us to both of these thresholds: we have developed powerful nuclear weapons, and with our growing knowledge of the techniques of rocketry, we are nearly ready to send men to other planets, God cannot allow us to make these trips if He is conducting other experiments. Or if He does allow us, He must first make us aware of the rules. He must tell us which planets we may visit and under what conditions. It may be that if we are to be allowed visiting rights, we must avoid contact, just as UFOs visiting earth have been instructed.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that scientific expeditions to earth (fulfilling the prophecy at Fatima) have now been sanctioned: "When you see nights lit up by strange lights, know that it is the great sign God is giving you that He is going to punish the world for its crimes of war and hunger and persecution of the church and the Holy Father." God, knowing that when the end of the experiment drew near, other civilizations would be allowed to investigate and examine us, prophesied our observation of flying saucers. UFOs that visited earth prior to 1947 may, for some unknown reason, have had special permission for their visits, or they may have been from foreign galaxies and been unaware of the rules, or they may have been disobedient angels.</p>

<p>Encouragingly, restrictions are still in effect, however. Open, unquestioned contact is still taboo, which means that there is still a chance (in God's mind) that we may survive. The only contacts made by UFOs today are of the variety which is hard to prove: they are always made in remote regions of the earth, usually with only one or two humans, who more often than not are hypnotized to prevent their remembering the incident. When they do remember, however, and when they tell their stories, they are not believed. The saucerians, we can be certain, count on the credibility gap to insure that earth's masses do not become aware of their mission.</p>

<p>It seems most unlikely that cruelty could be a part of God's character, but on the other hand it is to be seriously doubted whether He is much concerned with our life as flesh except for the entertainment we afford Him. Too often He has punished whole nations simply because some of their citizens were bad. He did away with Jacinta and Francisco at Fatima and admittedly brought plagues and famines to various peoples of the earth. If these victims have not been compensated by rewards in heaven, then we are wrong - then God is not (as we have always pictured Him) merciful and just. But since God has claimed mercy and justice as two of His attributes and since it appears that God is always truthful, it must be assumed that He does indeed balance the scales in heaven.</p>

<p>So what does He have planned for us? Is He really going to punish us? Or was his prophecy at Fatima only a threat to help keep us in line? For at the rate we are going now, we can't be trusted with one another without killing and warring; so how can we be trusted to carry out God's orders regarding travel to other planets?</p>

<p>Not to be overlooked is the possibility that God's plan for punishment is already in effect, having been instituted simultaneously with permission to UFOs to visit earth in the early 1940s The thought is terrifying but much evidence points to the conclusion that UFOs have God's permission, not only to investigate planet Earth but to abduct its inhabitants (animals and human) for scientific experimentation. Consider, for example, the case of the six planes that mysteriously disappeared during a routine flight from the Fort Lauderdale Naval Air Station on December 5, 1945. Five TMB Avengers were lost somewhere over the Atlantic only a few hours after takeoff. The rescue plane, a Martin Mariner, sent to find them disappeared along with the Avengers, and to this day no sign of the planes or of the twenty-seven crew members has been discovered.</p>

<p>Other mysterious disappearances, both of planes and of ships at sea, have been reported; but of course it is impossible to connect these disappearances with UFOs except by circumstantial evidence. However, at least one such abduction was witnessed. On March 5 1955, Eugene Metcalf of Paris, Illinois, reported a huge UFO, which he says pursued a fleeing jet plane, caught it and somehow seemed to engulf it, whereupon it streaked away with the jet a captive.</p>

<p>If these abductions constitute the punishment God forecast at Fatima, then, we can estimate, it has been going on for a minimum of twenty-two years, and we can only wonder how much longer it will last. A plausible time limit, it seems, would be the day when man attempts to travel to the moon or to another planet. If, as mentioned earlier, such exploration would interfere with or divulge the secret of God's game, then He must enter a new phase of His plan. On that day He must make a decision: either He must inform us of His true nature and tell us His rules for space travel or He must terminate the experiment!</p>

<p>It is not out of place here to make a plea to all the people of the earth and especially to their leaders. Moscow, Washington, London and all the rest: you have all been monitored and are still being monitored; God, whether you believe Him to be supernatural or otherwise, knows your thoughts and (within the rule of three to a customer) has tried to influence them. Before you send a man to the moon or the planets, there must be harmony on the earth. Man must prove his ability to obey God's rules. </p>

<p>And now we come to the final question: What can we, the people of the earth - God's subjects - do? Can we survive whatever punishment God sends? Will we, if we live the good life, if we love God, go to heaven? The considered answer to all these is Yes! We can go to heaven; such is the covenant God makes with us in the Bible. But my guess here is that our existence in heaven will be very different from what we expect. For instance, in heaven we will not be spiritual or supernatural beings. The emphasis will be on the electromagnetic aspect of our being, for we will live vicariously the lives of members of other civilizations in distant worlds. We will feel, see, hear and actually experience the emotions of our subjects.</p>

<p>And except for the ability to turn off communications, we will find the experience identical to the life we now live on the earth. There will be no fear of death, however; and to avoid suffering with our subjects, we can cut off communications. In essence we will be living a "spiritual" life. (Is this not what God promises?) But our heavenly bodies will be physical. When we are not in communication with one of our subjects, we will find that our physical bodies are artificial - composed of a material similar perhaps to plastic. Encased in this body will be a miniature computerized nervous system charged with all the thoughts and emotions ever experienced on the earth as flesh. If we wish to influence the lives of our subjects, we will be compelled to obey the rules: only three messages to a subject, delivered only while they sleep, and each message delivered only once.</p>

<p>God will choose which of us will survive as angels in heaven, according to our credentials as honest, faithful and trustworthy subjects. He will make this choice by analyzing the references of our guardian angels and by studying the monitoring tapes which are at this moment recording our lives. Those of us who do not measure up will be cast into hell. There are a number of ways that God could do this. He could lock us in on the life of a tragic being and make us suffer vicariously forever. Perhaps a trial in which we strive, within God's three rules, to lead one such miserable being into God's fold would constitute the condition known as purgatory. If we were successful, God would then allow us the freedom to choose when and if we should stay in contact with our future subjects. In other words, we would then have earned our way to heaven. Along the same line of thinking, a logical explanation of the state known as limbo appears: when the monitoring tapes are not tied in with a new body and simply lie unused - awaiting final judgements, so to speak - this condition fits exactly our concept of limbo.</p>

<p>In all, the evidence and the circumstances point overwhelmingly to the fact of a hereafter. The credibility gap has been bridged: Atheists and agnostics, whose common sense in the past denied them the comfort and security afforded by a belief in such things, can now join the ranks of the believers: there is a God after all! He can and does do what He claims, and we on earth are His subjects, inextricably involved in His experiment. No one will escape final judgment. No sin will go unpunished, and no good deed will go unrewarded. </p>

<p>This is God's word!</p>
