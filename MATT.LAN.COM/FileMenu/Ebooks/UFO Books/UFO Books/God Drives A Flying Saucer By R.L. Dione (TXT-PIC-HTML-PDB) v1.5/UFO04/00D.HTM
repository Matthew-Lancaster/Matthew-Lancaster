<p align="center"><font color="#000080"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p>This book will show that mankind is on the threshold of a sensational change, both in his secular view of life and in his religious concepts. He will navigate this threshold, however, only if he survives the consequences of his actions; for conceivably retribution from God, as promised in the scriptures, may end the savage drama now playing on planet Earth.</p>

<p>I present the material in this book, not as a theory based on some sort of mystical revelation or metaphysical hunch but rather as a collection of pure, hard facts - facts based on statistical evidence - which, along with some elementary logic, lead to the following startling conclusions.</p>

<p>1. Flying saucers are not only real but closely associated with the Christian religion.</p>

<p>2. Flying saucers visited earth during biblical times and even before.</p>

<p>3. Flying saucers exhibit most of the flight characteristics described by witnesses, and in so doing defy no laws of nature. Turns of 90 and 180 degrees while traveling at the speed of light can be made with no adverse effects on craft or occupants.</p>

<p>4. Flying saucers can and do appear and disappear almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>5. Without defying Einstein's laws of motion, flying saucers are capable of speeds closely approaching or equaling the speed of light (186,-000 miles a second).</p>

<p>6. Flying-saucer occupants are responsible for the scriptures, prophecies and miracles of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>7. God is not supernatural but rather super-technological and is capable of all" acts and all characteristics hitherto attributed to miraculous powers. That he created man in his image is not a myth or a parable; for God, while humanoid, is nevertheless immortal through technology.</p>

<p>All of these conclusions will be documented, explained and proved in the pages that follow.</p>

<p>I leave it to other writers and to the several civilian bodies investigating UFOs to provide the empirical evidence of the actuality of flying saucers. Those who can be persuaded of the existence of flying saucers by sheer weight of numbers of reliable sightings are already convinced, and to them I need explain only the what and the why of UFOs. But to those who, because of governmental debunking techniques or because of conflicting religious beliefs, are not convinced, I offer something more substantial than the empirical evidence of sightings by others. </p>

<p>I will not bore you with the mountains of reliable accounts of UFOs seen by people in every walk of life, including students, teachers, policemen, doctors, astronomers, physicists, movie stars, Air Force and civilian pilots, clergymen and political leaders; I will not ask you to take my word, though I have seen UFOs on three separate occasions. I will use a different approach: I will ask you to use the same common sense that tells you UFOs do not exist to tell you that they do. I will use a technique of proof based partly on an explanation of the technology of UFOs and partly on the laws of probability. In sum, I will bridge the credibility gap.</p>

<p>At the same time I will bridge the credibility gap concerning the miracles of the Bible. For example, I will show that the Bible, though divinely inspired, was not supernaturally inspired. I will show and explain how divine inspiration is in fact always imposed by a technological device on board a nearby UFO. And we shall see that God always refers to this device as the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And finally I will show why God created man and Why UFO sightings herald a new era in God's plan.</p>
