<p>"For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulders: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace." </p>

<p>This prophecy, appearing in Isaias, Chapter 9, was written hundreds of years prior to the event and is but one of a number of prophetic passages foretelling the birth of Jesus. In Michias Chapter 5, the prophet even tells where Jesus will be born: "And thou, Bethlehem Ephrata, art a little one among the thousands of Juda: out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler of Israel: and his going forth is from the beginning from the days of eternity."</p>

<p>Were the prophets guessing, or did they know? And if they knew, how did they know? The answer is simple: they knew because God had told them! And God knew, not because of supernatural vision, but because He knew He could make it happen. God's plan for conversion of the gentiles through Jesus was conceived at least seven hundred years prior to the execution of the plan. And the prophecies, of course, served to illustrate God's wisdom and at the same time enhance the impact of Jesus.</p>

<p>As added insurance that Jesus would be accepted as His agent, God employed the incomprehensible technology of His super society in an incredibly efficient scheme to impress the people of earth. That we were impressed will never be questioned, but how we were impressed finally comes to light now - after nearly two thousand years. (God himself must have anticipated this, because with the inevitable advance of science - which involves better understanding of nature - superstition gives way to knowledge; that which was impossible yesterday becomes possible today, and tomorrow we will wonder why we ever thought it impossible.)</p>

<p>As for the miracles of Jesus, practically all of them can be explained in terms of flying-saucer devices already explained. In fact, only with rare exceptions did God or Jesus use devices other than those employed at Fatima. The Immaculate Conception, of course, was one of these exceptions. We can be reasonably certain, however, that a biological specialist, the angel Gabriel, used the hypnotizing device prior to and during the artificial insemination of Mary; and to insure that she retained her badge of virginity, Gabriel undoubtedly used a hypodermic needle. </p>

<p>This explanation is not heresy: Mary was still a virgin as proclaimed, and it may well be that the sperm used was God's, making Jesus the Son of God just as the Bible teaches. In terms of man's understanding of science at that time, no other explanation than that it was a miracle would have made any sense. And of course that is exactly what God wanted - a miraculous birth!</p>

<p>The star over Bethlehem, as mentioned earlier was also a simple miracle to perform: a hovering luminous flying saucer served the purpose of "glorifying" the event.</p>

<p>Little is known of the life of Jesus until he was a matured adult, and this is understandable once we recognize God's method of operation: from all the evidence it is apparent that God never lies to His "divinely inspired" writers. Of course, this doesn't mean that He tells all; but what He does tell is essentially true, and what mysticism we find in His messages we read into them ourselves.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it becomes clear why we see no account of Jesus' early life. The saucerians were utilizing this time for two purposes. First, to properly fulfill his role, Jesus had to be educated and indoctrinated. He had to practice the performance of many of his miracles, and he may even have had to undergo some biological changes.</p>

<p>The second purpose for the thirty-year interlude is one which we should view with alarm: it, was during this time that God set the stage. By the use of hypnotism He created the twisted, blinded and insane subjects whom Jesus was to cure at a later date. The post-hypnotic suggestion in each case would include instructions to the subject that he would be cured when contact with Jesus was made. Also to insure that Jesus could cure all those who sought his help, measures were undoubtedly taken to dissuade truly afflicted members of society from seeking his aid. Again, we may assume that hypnotism was employed for this purpose.</p>

<p>If this theory sounds too bizarre, too labored, or if it portrays God as too cruel, then, as an alternative, what can we believe? Can we really believe that Jesus could truly cure a physically deformed subject? Could he by the simple touch of his hand cause a stunted limb to grow to normal size? (An account is recorded of his curing a man with a withered hand, but it should be pointed out that a withered hand is not necessarily stunted.) Could he make a new limb appear where one was missing? If he could, he never did, for no such account appears in the Bible. Are we to believe, then, that people with missing limbs didn't exist in those days, or that such people never cared to be cured? Or may we conclude what is obvious: that neither Jesus nor anyone else can perform any act in defiance of nature's laws, and that Jesus, in appearing to do so, was in reality only bringing hypnotized subjects out of a trance? Certainly if Jesus used supernatural powers to effect his cures, then nothing, including the regeneration of limbs should have been impossible for him.</p>

<p>So we see once again, as at Fatima when the people of the earth were infected with Spanish influenzas that God does indeed work His wonders in a strange way. Healthy bodies were afflicted artificially with all manner of suffering so that He, through Jesus, could impress the people of earth and convert the gentiles to a belief in Him!</p>

<p>One can only hope that He balanced the scales for these poor unfortunates in a future life: not only because they deserve it but also because one prefers to think that He does have consideration and concern for each individual human being. If He is as dispassionate, as cold and indifferent, as some of His acts would lead us to believe, then undoubtedly we are in danger!</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that a large proportion of the miraculous cures effected by Jesus involved the "casting out of devils." To begin with, a man like Jesus, reputed to have supernatural wisdom and power, should have known that people are not possessed by devils or demons. But a man who knew that a technological device was interfering with normal brain function could in all honesty refer to the condition as being "possessed by the devil."</p>

<p>Typical of the honesty in the Bible, Jesus practically admits using the method just described. In Matthew, Chapter 12, he says, "But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you." Once again we see the reference to the spirit; I reiterate, there can be no doubt that this is the brain-manipulating device. Lest you question this usage, I ask you to consider the following passage from Joel, Chapter 2: "And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions." Can there be any doubt of the meaning of this passage?</p>

<p>As further proof, we read Jesus' instructions to the apostles telling them not how the brain manipulator works but that it does work. Jesus tells the Twelve, in Matthew, Chapter 10, that when they go out to spread the word of God, they will meet with abuse. "But when they deliver you up," he instructs, "do not be anxious how or what you are to speak; for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who are speaking, but the spirit of your Father who speaks through you." In those days the cloud formations camouflaging the cloud-UFOs with their brain manipulaters must have been little short of spectacular.</p>

<p>The casting out of demons by Jesus always followed a pattern typified by the following incident from Matthew, Chapter 17. Into Jesus' presence a father brings his lunatic son, who, it is described, often falls into flaming embers and into the deep waters. And Jesus says, "O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? Bring him here to me .... And Jesus rebuked him; and the devil went out of him; and from that moment the boy was cured."</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable cure of this type, and one which points to the correctness of the view presented in these pages, involves the passage of demons from two men into a herd of swine. (In the Book of Luke there was only one possessed man, but otherwise the incident is identical.) The following from Matthew, Chapter 8, describes two men in the country of Gerasa who were so violently possessed that no one dared pass their way. On seeing Jesus, they shouted abuse at him. "Now not very far from them was a herd of swine, feeding. And the devils kept entreating him, saying, 'If thou cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.' And he said to them, 'Go!' And they came out and entered into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and perished in the water."</p>

<p>The two features of this story are intriguing: first, since Jesus had proved many times before that he could "cast out devils" without injury to other animals or to humans, why did he choose to have these poor animals suffer death by drowning - a death which is slow and frightening? Was it not simply to dramatize the incident? The illusion was extremely impressive then, as it would be today, but today Jesus would have problems: today he would have had to contend with those members of society who are opposed to cruelty to animals, even when such cruelty involves no suffering and is connected with scientific investigation. Jesus obviously experienced no such compassion for dumb animals.</p>

<p>The second intriguing aspect of the story of the swine is the apparent verification of the effectiveness on animals of the brain-manipulating device. If through its use God can make swine walk over a cliff to their death, then it must be completely effective, and it becomes increasingly apparent how God was able to bring plagues of locusts to strip the crops and create famines where and when He pleased. And we see also how He brought quail to the desert of Sin to feed the fleeing Israelites.</p>

<p>Once again I call upon your common sense and ask you to consider the actions of the swine. What manner of supernatural power governed their will-to-act nerve center and caused them to act in violation of the natural instinct to survive? Did the demons of Jesus exert physical pressure against the muscles of their victims, or did they interfere in some way with the electrical communication between brain and muscles? It seems a safe assumption that even Jesus would deny physical attributes to the demons, which rules out the possibility that physical force was used. Any other force would have to be electrical, and would have to impinge electrically upon the nervous systems of the subjects.</p>

<p>Experiments being conducted at the Yale School of Medicine involving cats, monkeys and other animals show that desired responses can be elicited from the animals by means of radio transmission to electrodes implanted in the brain. It has been found that such factors as intensity, duration and frequency of radio waves, coupled with the location of the electrodes, determine what reactions will occur. For example, a five-second stimulation of the sulcus cruciatus in the frontal area of the brain causes the left hind leg of a cat to lift off the ground. When the amperage is increased, the leg lifts higher.</p>

<p>Such experiments are in their infancy now, but conceivably scientists will in time be able to make animals walk by means of this brain-manipulating device. And eventually science will find a way to eliminate the need for implanting electrodes in the brain. God's technology obviously accomplished this well over two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Besides casting out devils, Jesus cured many persons suffering from strange and unexplained paralysis (a condition easily invoked even today with our clumsy understanding of hypnotism). A hypnotically induced paralytic condition resembling death would also account for Jesus' apparent ability to resurrect the dead. To substantiate this conclusion, one need only point out that Jesus never resurrected genuine cadavers - persons certified to be dead, and preferably for an appreciable length of time. Jesus even admitted that one "dead" subject was only sleeping. From Matthew, Chapter 9, we read: "And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a din, he said, 'Begone, the girl is asleep, not dead.' And they laughed him to scorn. But when the crowd had been put out, he went in and took her by the hand; and the girl arose. And the report of this spread throughout the district." </p>

<p>The breaking of a hypnotic trance can be accomplished in almost any manner, provided the subject is made aware that he is to awaken on a given signal. Often the hypnotist will simply command that the subject awaken when told; at other times he may instruct the subject to awaken at the count of three or perhaps at the snap of his fingers. The point is that the subject, once knowing what the signal is, will awaken on that signal. Thus it was possible for Jesus to bring his subjects out of their trances by what appeared to be miraculous methods. Often this was accomplished by a mere touch of the hand or by a simple command.</p>

<p>At other times the subject had merely to touch Jesus' robe in order to be cured. A woman suffering from hemorrhages (a symptom which could very likely be hypnotically induced, since the opposite - the stopping of bleeding - has been accomplished through hypnotism) followed Jesus, saying to herself, as if repeating a command, "If I touch but his cloak, I shall be saved." Needless to say, upon her touching his cloak, the bleeding stopped, and she was saved.</p>

<p>She was saved, but her actions were suspiciously more indicative of a hypnotic trance than of an act of faith. For example, who told her that she had simply to touch his cloak? Would not most people, hearing of such a supernatural healer, first petition him for aid and not decide the manner in which it would be accomplished?</p>

<p>Finally, with the following question, I direct one last fatal blow at the authenticity of Jesus' power as a supernatural healer. Why did he not, with one all-inclusive announcement, heal all the faithful afflicted of his time? There is no reasonable answer to this question except the admission that indeed he was not supernatural.</p>

<p>In view of some other illusions performed by Jesus, it is clearly evident that he was in continual contact with a UFO. Hidden from view in the clouds above (or enveloped in its own cloud camouflage), this UFO was instrumental in the performance of such miracles as Jesus' feeding five thousand people with five loaves of bread, Jesus' striking Saul blind and paralyzed, and the water-walking episode involving Jesus and Peter. And finally the circumstances of the crucifixion and the subsequent resurrection indicated that a UFO was involved. </p>

<p>In the feeding of five thousand with five loaves of bread, as recorded in Mark, Chapter 6 - the people (for reasons unexplained in the text) were required to lie on the ground in groups of fifties or one hundred before they were fed. Rather than to evoke some supernatural force, this, I submit, was done to expedite the count: the hovering UFO had to know how much food to deliver. (It is reassuring to know that God also finds convenience in the decimal system of numbers; in fact, it would be surprising to learn He had not taught the system to us.) We can be sure, though no mention is made of it, that the groups were instructed to recline face down, to facilitate, the secretive delivery of the food by the UFO. </p>

<p>The evidence of UFOs in the water-walking episode is less speculative than in the feeding incident, for in this case we see physical evidence of the craft. A strong wind which subsides immediately when the water walkers enter the boat is one of the characteristics which accompanied the arrival of the cloud-UFO at Fatima. A clue to the method used to execute this miracle can be found in Rex Heflin's Polaroid shot mentioned earlier. If Heflin's UFO could cause earth particles to lift up, then obviously a stronger force of a similar nature could cause men to appear to walk on water. It is probably significant that in the account Jesus was more proficient in the stunt than was Peter; Jesus reproached Peter for his ineptitude, attributing it to a lack of faith. </p>

<p>In a similar incident recorded in Mark Chapter 4, we find Jesus in a boat on the lake with the twelve Apostles, when a strong gale comes up. Jesus, apparently asleep in the stern, is awakened by his fearful servants, whereupon he rebukes the wind, saying, "Peace, be still." And the wind falls and the waters become calm. One need only contemplate what would happen to the air surrounding a hovering, gravity-free UFO to understand how such winds could be created.</p>

<p>It seems doubtful whether Jesus carried with him any saucerian devices, such as paralyzing ray guns or mind-reading and brain-manipulating machines. It would have been far simpler, when the occasion demanded, to have a nearby UFO perform these tasks. Thus we may assume that Jesus' mind-reading ability (which is well substantiated in the Bible) was in reality a three-way system: the saucer reading the mind of the subject, then relaying the message to Jesus, who then communicated with the subject.</p>

<p>And when Jesus appeared to Saul on the road to Damascus (long after the resurrection), quite obviously a UFO was involved. In the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 23, Saul reports: "Suddenly about noon there shone round about me a great light from heaven and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?' And I answered, 'Who art thou, Lord?' And he answered me, 'I am Jesus Of Nazareth, whom thou art persecuting.' And my companion saw indeed the light. but they did not hear the voice of him who was speaking to me."</p>

<p>If a UFO, performing much as did the UFO at Fatima, was not responsible for the darkening of the sun during the crucifixion of Jesus, then the alternative explanations are even less digestible: in some way the rate of conversion of hydrogen to energy on the sun was slowed during the three hours that Jesus was on the cross; or, if you prefer, God slipped invisible smoked glasses over the eyes of all present that day. For obviously, even to those who believe in the supernatural, something caused the light from the sun to diminish. Shall we believe that the sun has a supernatural mind also and that God commanded it to dim its light? Or shall we, after all, accept the perfectly reasonable explanation that the effect was produced by a disc UFO exactly as it would be nearly two thousand years later at Fatima?</p>

<p>Curiously, Jesus, with his superior spiritual strength was the first of the three crucified that day to die. One might think that such a man would have been the last to let life slip from his grasp; but when the soldiers came back three hours after the crucifixion with orders to break the legs (to hasten death) of those still alive, only Jesus of the three was not alive - at least he seemed to be dead. It had been prophesied that not a bone of his body would be broken, but that his flesh would be pierced - and so it was. One of the soldiers, apparently acting under compulsion (though we now realize that he was directed by the UFO overhead), drove his lance into Jesus' side. If the UFO was not responsible for this prophecy-fulfilling act, then, of course, we will have to admit, an invisible, supernatural God took the soldier by the arm and made the thrust.</p>

<p>At any rate, the two robbers had their legs broken, while Jesus hung intact, head slumped, blood trickling from the wound in his side - dead! But was he really dead? Who put a stethoscope to his chest? Who, with the guardian UFO overhead, would have been able to swing a club at those legs or put a lance through that heart? For even in a hypnotic trance a body can be killed, and Jesus, we can be sure, was not meant to die on the cross that day at Calvary.</p>

<p>Not only was he not meant to die: there is little to indicate that he expected to suffer any great physical pain. For surely, even if he was supernatural, he could have controlled his threshold of pain and fulfilled his promise to suffer for mankind by submitting to an absolute minimum of discomfort. After all, the nature of pain and the ability to withstand it vary from person to person. What to one would be agonizing torture might to another be only mildly uncomfortable. Pain is subjective.</p>

<p>Under hypnosis almost any degree of pain can be tolerated. A mild trance will do for mild discomfort, but a deeper one is necessary to alleviate severe pain. At one point during his ordeal on the cross Jesus indicated that perhaps a deeper trance was necessary. How else can we explain his plea, "My God my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" The wording of his outcry should be studied very carefully, for in it we find conclusive proof that Jesus was in contact with a UFO!</p>

<p>At the outset it should be pointed out that Jesus was not asking for spiritual or physical strength to endure the pain. Such a plea would by no stretch of the imagination be worded as a condemnation of God - as this one was! Jesus (who preached, "Amen I say to you, if you have faith and do not waver ... all things whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you shall receive") in his moment of truth accused God of forsaking him. The distinction is important: Jesus did not forsake God; God forsook Jesus. There can be no doubt that Jesus' plea concerned what he felt was a broken promise. How else could he have felt that God had forsaken him? Even to suspect such a thing of a supernatural, all-knowing, all-good God is unthinkable; and to further complicate the matter, how could a supernatural, all-knowing, all-good, mind-reading miracle worker like Jesus even ask such a question? Could it be that supernatural mind readers cannot read other supernatural minds? For as it turned out, God had not forsaken Jesus - not completely.</p>

<p>Some theologians, in an attempt to explain this incident, claim that the "human side" of Jesus was responsible for his show of faithlessness - that Jesus was merely illustrating the frailty of flesh. Such a conclusion, however, repudiates fact: the fact is that Jesus never exhibited fleshly weakness. He never begged God for mercy or for strength; he only petitioned Him to fulfill a promise.</p>

<p>In the last analysis, the incident makes sense only when we conclude that Jesus experienced more pain than he had been led to believe he would. And his knowledge that the saucerian above was reading his mind (thus being aware of his suffering) was allowing the pain to continue despite his ability to stop it. This saucerian (God) may in a sense have betrayed Jesus after all. He may have allowed Jesus to suffer a little more than promised in order to remain above reproach in the matter of honesty. For someday, when He reveals the whole story to us, God will show that at no time has He ever lied. And He will no doubt reproach us for having all the facts and still not being able to understand the truth.</p>

<p>The story of the resurrection, like the story of the crucifixion, is in no way inconsistent with the obvious fact of UFO involvement. The removal of the huge stone from the entrance of the tomb and Jesus' ascension into a "cloud" were both accomplished by the same method as was the water-walking episode. It should be much easier for anyone to picture a UFO removing the slab from the tomb than to imagine an invisible, supernatural being shouldering it out of the way. And it makes no sense at all to theorize that Jesus was raised up to the cloud by no method at all, especially when we have seen evidence that UFOs can lift physical objects by exerting force over a distance. Surely no one believes that magnets utilize supernatural power to exert their type of force, yet the phenomenon is equally as amazing as Jesus' ascension to the cloud which eventually carried him off to heaven.</p>

<p>It is purely conjectural at this point whether the risen Jesus survives, physically intact, to this day. Whether his flesh would age like ours or his organs would deteriorate is not made clear in the scriptures; what is made clear is that he is immortal. Replacement of worn organs by artificial parts is not beyond the realm of possibility, but neither is victory over the aging process. What we can be certain of is that the electrical apparatus - the thoughts, the emotions, the memories and the conscious awareness that were Jesus - are still alive, and always will be. He will come again, as prophesied, on his huge white cloud!</p>
