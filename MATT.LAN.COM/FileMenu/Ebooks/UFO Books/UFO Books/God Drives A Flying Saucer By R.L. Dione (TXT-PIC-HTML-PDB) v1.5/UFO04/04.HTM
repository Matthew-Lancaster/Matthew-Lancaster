<p>Remarkable heating effects characterize many UFO encounters. In some cases the heat seems incidental, but in others it appears intentional, as if it were being tested as a weapon. Perhaps the most famous case of heat being used as a weapon was the incident at Fort Itaipu involving two sentries of the Brazilian army. On November 4, 1957, the two soldiers noticed what first appeared to be a new star. But then the object began moving toward the fort, growing in size until it was as large as the full moon. It drifted down over the sleeping garrison, and the sentries reported later that it was disc-shaped and glowed a brilliant orange. It made a humming sound as it hung there overhead.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Suddenly the humming became a high-pitched crescendo of unearthly sound. The sentries dropped to the ground screaming in agony; it seemed to them that their clothing had suddenly caught fire. One of the men managed to crawl to shelter under a nearby cannon, and his screams alerted the garrison. The other sentry, exposed, lay unconscious on the ground. Before it was all over, the UFO had knocked out the electric power system and turned the entire garrison into a panic-stricken mob. Later it was reported that both sentries had suffered first-and second-degree burns, but (attesting to the unearthly nature of the weapon) the burns occurred only on areas of the skin covered by clothing.</p>

<p>That UFOs can radiate unbelievable heat, focused not only on a point, as in this case, but also over wide areas, is substantiated by a number of other eyewitness reports. One of the best and most reliable of these comes from a lumber dealer in France.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of October 20, 1954, in the Lusigny-sur-Barse Forest, in northeast central France, Robert Reveille saw a UFO. It fluttered and bobbed just above the trees, a strange discoid object about twenty feet in diameter. As he watched he noticed a perceptible rise in the temperature, and in a few moments the craft bolted upward and was quickly lost from sight. Seconds later a thick fog rose from the woods, and Reveille reports, "the heat grew intolerable."</p>

<p>When he later entered the area, Reveille discovered that despite the rain, the site was completely dry. The foliage, the trees and even the ground were as dry as if the sun had been shining all day.</p>

<p>Whether the UFO caused the rain is not made clear in the account, but it would be surprising to learn that a device capable of producing such tremendous heat could not evaporate water from any source (as the sun does), hold it in its electrically charged field and at its discretion release the moisture to form rain.</p>

<p>Not infrequently reports of strange and powerful lighting effects are given by UFO sighters: recall the eerie red light that bathed the scene at Exeter as the UFO hovered overhead. Daylighting effects are also regularly reported, attesting to the unbelievable power of the light source.</p>

<p>Interviewing the family of a high-ranking Air Force officer at Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire, Fuller, again in Incident at Exeter, comes up with some facts concerning UFO lighting effects.</p>

<p>The UFO in question came down just off the edge of the runway adjacent to the family living quarters. It glowed a brilliant orange, so bright that one of the wives actually got up and started to dress, thinking it was morning, although it was still the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Other reports ascribed to UFOs the ability to produce multichromatic spectral effects. A photograph taken in Brighten Township, Pennsylvania, by James Lucci shows a light like a whirling halo below a flying saucer. Lucci reported that the halo had not been visible to the naked eye, a fact which seems to suggest that UFOs can also produce electromagnetic radiation outside the range of human vision - perhaps, in this case at least, as a byproduct of the gravity-control system.</p>

<p>Almost from the moment of Arnold's famous sighting in 1947, rumor doggedly held that radioactive radiation was emitted by UFOs, even though concrete evidence had never established the fact. Then, in 1950, two physicists working for the Atomic Energy Commission reported to Edward Ruppelt of Project Blue Book the results of some tests they had conducted: on two occasions, they told Ruppelt, UFOs had been sighted simultaneously with abnormally high Geiger counter readings at a research lab. Later these two scientists formed a group with automatic sky-watching Geiger devices and soon verified their earlier findings: when UFOs were sighted visually in the vicinity of radiation-detection centers, the readings soared to as much as one hundred times the normal atmospheric background reading. A reasonable explanation for such radiation would be that the electromagnetic gravity-control device on UFOs is atomic-powered. At any rate, radioactive radiation in conjunction with UFOs is now an established fact.</p>

<p>Another established fact is that UFOs while in flight sometimes emit a tangible substance which drifts down to the ground. This apparent exhaust material, commonly referred to as "angels hair," was seen in Ohio by fifteen thousand people at a football game. The substance, light and lacy, drifts to the ground much like snow and is variously described as like "cotton candy streamers," "the substance of cobwebs" or "fluffy pieces of cotton." As in the Ohio case, when the spectators watched a group of saucers spew out the stuff, it always sublimes or otherwise vanishes within a few minutes after striking the ground. When handled and balled up, it turns gelatinous, then vanishes, and as a consequence none of it has ever made it to the laboratory for analysis.</p>

<p>Some speculations hold that the substance is composed of ionized gases of the atmosphere, formed perhaps by the strong electromagnetic fields of the UFOs. Such an explanation, however, fails to account for similar sightings in which the angels'-hair phenomenon failed to manifest itself. So what it is, or what function its serves, is open to question. All that can be said with certainty is that it does exist.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of UFOs is the strange effect they have on animals: dogs, horses, cattle and birds seem to sense the presence of UFOs before the object comes into view. Some humans have reported "sensing" UFOs before sighting them. Recent experiments conducted as a result of this phenomenon have led to the fascinating discovery that animals and humans are indeed sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. It has been found that animals are more acutely attuned to the radiation than humans, and as might be expected, that the degree of sensitivity varies from person to person, just as the frequency range of audibility varies. Children and young adults can hear sound at both the upper and the lower frequency range better than older adults, while animals surpass all humans in these categories. Thus it appears that sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation is analogous to sensitivity to sound.</p>

<p>Research at Cornell University has established that unlike sound, electromagnetic radiation bypasses the auditory system, directly stimulating the brain, producing a buzzing sensation which subjects say seems to emanate a few feet above the forehead. So it appears that we do have a sixth sense after all - a sense which, it seems, may prove more important than the other five put together.</p>

<p>A case pertinent to this study is recorded by Frank Edwards in Flying Saucers - Serious Business. Recounting the experience of some personal friends who were at a drive-in theatre with their two small children, Edwards says that a sound like that of bees was first noticed by the children, but that the parents, hearing nothing, dismissed the incident as an imaginative game. But after a few minutes the father also heard the sound - like that of a swarm of bees. And suddenly there appeared over the drive-in at low altitude a double-convex, disc-shaped object. Lights around the rim of the craft blinked on and off as it glided silently (except for the buzzing) overhead. The object was seen and heard by hundreds of theater patrons, but curiously, although the buzzing sound was distinct to others, the mother of the two children heard nothing.</p>

<p>The UFO, estimated to be at an altitude of one hundred feet, continued on its course above the theater, and as it moved away the buzzing sound slowly diminished.</p>

<p>We see in this episode proof that "buzzing" is not caused by conventional sound: when its frequency approaches the limits of human sensitivity, sound would never be described as like that from bees. Sound on the low end of the scale becomes a throbbing moan, and on the high end it becomes a piercing squeak. And since the mother was not deaf, we can account for her not hearing the "bees" only by assuming that the stimulus was not conventional sound but rather electromagnetic radiation, to which she apparently is insensitive. By the same reasoning the children were more sensitive to the stimulus than the father.</p>

<p>The conclusion which must be drawn from the evidence in this case and similar cases, as well as from the tests at Cornell, is that the brain, human and animal, is an electromagnetic receiver, similar in many respects to a radio. Such a conclusion should not be surprising in view of the fact that impulses to the brain from all systems and organs of the body are electrical. The optical system converts light to electricity, which in turn stimulates the visual areas of the brain; the auditory system does the same with sound. Even the will to act is governed by electrical impulses to the brain.</p>

<p>Experiments involving the implantation of electrodes directly in the brains of animals have shown that electrical stimulation to specific parts of the brain can control certain emotions. If these signals can be given directly, then theoretically they can be transmitted over a distance, to be received by our "brain radios."</p>

<p>The brain is also a transmitter. The electro-encephalograph, a device used to graph the electrical patterns of the brain, utilizes the brain's electromagnetic transmissions. True, it is a contact device, but contact is made only with the skull; the electrodes are not implanted in the brain itself. Therefore, when the instrument is used, the brain is transmitting an electrical signal over a distance of as much as an inch or more. So again in theory we can imagine a device capable of refining and amplifying these signals, making it possible to receive them from long distances.</p>

<p>The famous Steep Rock Lake case, in which a senior executive of the Steep Rock iron mines and his wife watched a UFO for several minutes, is but one of many cases which suggest that saucerians can pick up electrical signals from humans.</p>

<p>The incident occurred in Ontario, Canada, on July 2, 1950, when the couple were picnicking at Sawtooth Bay. They had beached their boat in a sandy inlet surrounded by huge formations of rock and had just spread a blanket to set out their lunch, when suddenly the air was rocked by a "strange vibration." It was as if there had been an explosion, except that there was no sound.</p>

<p>The husband, sensing the unusual character of the phenomenon, scrambled up a rock formation, and as he peered through a cleft his gaze fell on an unbelievable scene: less than four hundred yards distant, just off shore, was a curious disc-shaped object. Shining brightly in the noonday sun, it floated lightly in the water, as if it might be made of a metal like aluminum. It looked like two saucers joined at the rims, and around the rims were black openings similar to portholes. The man and his wife, who later joined him, both estimated the diameter of the object to be about fifty feet. But what really shocked them was the "little men" milling about on the deck of the craft, busily engaged in some task which the two witnesses could not fathom.</p>

<p>At the center of the craft was a large hoop antenna which appeared to be operated by one of the little creatures stationed near it. The other figures moved about like automatons, always turning their heads before turning their feet and always stopping as a group whenever the hoop antenna stopped.</p>

<p>The couple noted that the antenna always stopped when it pointed to the cleft in the rock where they were concealed. When they drew back out of sight behind the rocks, they discovered that the antenna would continue its rotation, and the little men would resume their labor.</p>

<p>A sighting similar to this one - little men, disc-shaped craft floating in shallow water and a strange antenna - had been made a number of years earlier in this same region of Canada. And the four witnesses, who watched from a distance of 450 yards, concurred that the focus of attention by the little saucerians was a nearby deer which their antenna seemed to point out.</p>

<p>The evidence in these two cases suggests only that the saucerians can locate brain waves, not necessarily that they can read them. However, in the historic dogfight between Second Lieutenant George F. Gorman and a tiny UFO, the Air Force pilot reported that the "thing" seemed to anticipate his maneuvers as if reading his mind.</p>

<p>Even more startling evidence for the use of such a technology is found in the pages of John G. Fuller's The Interrupted Journey. The circumstances of Barney and Betty Hill's story of abduction by a crew of saucerians and their subsequent adventure defies any system of logic to refute it. Their story, told under hypnosis to a reputable psychiatrist, is undoubtedly true, incredible as it may seem. But it gains stature in light of the theory just contemplated. We quote from Fuller's book a section of tape made in the psychiatrist's office by Barney Hill while under deep hypnosis. He is recalling the events just prior to the abduction, when the UFO was only a few hundred feet distant. He recalls watching, through binoculars, the object and its occupants, his attention focused on a humanoid creature who appears to be the leader:</p>

<p>BARNEY. ... I feel like a rabbit. <br>
DOCTOR. What do you mean by that? <br>
BARNEY. I was hunting for rabbits in Virginia. And this cute little bunny went into a bush that was not very big. And my cousin Marge was on one side of the bush and I was on the other - with a hat. And the poor little bunny thought he was safe. And it tickled me, because he was just hiding behind a little stalk, which meant security to him - when I pounced on him, and threw my hat on him, and captured the poor little bunny who thought he was safe.</p>

<p>Funny I thought of that - right out there on the field. I feel like a rabbit. </p>

<p>DOCTOR. What was Betty doing all this time? <br>
BARNEY. I can't hear her.<br>
DOCTOR. Did you make any outcry to her the way you did to me?<br>
BARNEY. I - can't remember - I don't know ... I did not.<br>
DOCTOR. You would remember if you did. <br>
BARNEY. I did not. I know this creature is telling me something.<br>
DOCTOR. Telling you something? How? How is he getting it to you?<br>
BARNEY. I can see it in his face. No, his lips are not moving.<br>
DOCTOR. Go on. He's telling you something. <br>
BARNEY. And he's looking at me. And he's just telling me: Don't be afraid. I'm not a bunny. I'm going to be ... I'm going to be safe. He didn't tell me I was that bunny.<br>
DOCTOR. What did he tell you?<br>
BARNEY (as if he's quoting what he was told). Stay there - and keep looking. Just keep looking - and stay there. And just keep looking. Just keep looking. <br>
DOCTOR. Could you hear him tell you? <br>
BARNEY. Oh! I got the binoculars away from my eyes. 'Cause if I don't, I'll just stand there. <br>
DOCTOR. Did you hear him tell you this? <br>
BARNEY. Oh, no. He didn't say it. <br>
DOCTOR. You felt he said it? <br>
BARNEY (very firmly). I know. <br>
DOCTOR. You know he Said it?<br>
BARNEY. Yes. Just stay there, he said. (Now his voice breaks in extreme terror.) It's pounding in my head!</p>

<p>The saucerian in this incident was not only receiving and interpreting brain waves from Barney Hill but also sending the subject an intelligible signal. He was in fact using a form of telepathy which, if our observations are correct, is Based on a system of technology rather than on extrasensory perception; and furthermore, it is evident that the creature was inducing a hypnotic state in the subject. A "beeping" sound which occurred later in the account was probably used to strengthen the hypnotic condition of both Barney and his wife.</p>

<p>On board the saucer a few minutes later, Betty Hill recalls (four years later in the doctor's office and under hypnosis), the creatures' mouths were lipless slits and didn't seem to move when they spoke. At one point in her "conversation" with one of them, curiously the saucerian failed to understand the meaning of time. This apparently insignificant little detail, meaningless in light of our present technology, becomes a mountain of proof when analyzed in terms of saucer technology: how could a creature, reading our thoughts (and not necessarily familiar with our language), fathom the meaning of a word which we ourselves do not understand? The concept of time may be the most abstract concept that humans have. For example, examine such of your thoughts as "It was a long time ago" or "I've been here a long time." There is no imagery connected with these thoughts. One must know the word symbolism or imagery to understand them. If, as some evidence indicates, saucerians do not age, then an expression like "You're older than I" would be meaningless to them unless they understood the language.</p>

<p>And so the saucerian was not necessarily unaware of the concept of time (as one might think on reading Fuller's book), nor was Betty Hill imagining the whole abduction episode, throwing in little embellishments here and there for flavor and intrigue; on the contrary, this little detail, it turns out, is one of the strengthening features of the whole story. The saucerian simply did not know the meaning of the word, and Betty Hill's mind projected no meaningful image.</p>

<p>Similar, though not as positive, evidence is revealed by Barney Hill's hesitation when he recalls the saucerian's message to him: "I'm not a bunny. I'm going to be ... I'm going to be safe." Why should Barney hesitate over the word safe? A likely answer is that the message was transmitted originally by the saucerian, not as word symbols but as images, and the image for the concept safe is also abstract and was therefore transmitted in complex images.</p>

<p>When earth scientists achieved a breakthrough in this area of communications, a new era in our culture will have been born. The barrier presented by language differences will be swept away, to be replaced by a kind of understanding, between both individuals and nations, never before dreamed of. The blind will see, and the deaf will hear. Crime will become a thing of the past. Criminal tendencies and dangerous mental disorders will be diagnosed positively long before they ever jeopardize society, and cures for them will flourish. Education will be revolutionized by such technology: learning will be swift and painless and unbelievably efficient. And the significance to medicine outstrips the imagination: instant hypnosis, with instant post-hypnotic suggestion, will cure many illnesses. Whole environmental backgrounds will be erased and new ones superimposed to remake individuals incapacitated as a result of traumatic backgrounds. Communication with animals and insects will be possible. Have you ever noticed how your dog often seems to read your mind? Remember, the dog has a very sensitive electromagnetic receiver.</p>

<p>UFOs, particularly in the Exeter incidents, have displayed intense interest in high-voltage lines which, as you probably know, carry alternating electric current. And alternating electric current creates alternating magnetic fields, which, to the saucerians, might indicate a life form. We think Mr. Saucerian has been stymied in his efforts to decipher "high-voltage" language, though he has spent long hours at the job. No other theory makes as much sense in view of the time spent by UFOs at these places. To measure the power, to steal the power or to analyze it in any way could have been done quickly by these creatures; yet from hundreds of reports we see that the saucers have spent many hours over high-voltage lines.</p>

<p>An unsettling sidelight - unsettling at least to those who believe man to be the supreme physical being of the universe - is the fact that the Hills' saucer men, as well as many other reported UFO creatures, are lipless. How long will it take earthlings after speech becomes obsolete to evolve as lipless creatures? Consider further that the Hills' creatures are not (as we shall see) the originals, that in fact these saucerians were probably at our present stage of development when the original saucer beings were roaming the galaxies. In all it would appear we have a lot of catching up to do.</p>
