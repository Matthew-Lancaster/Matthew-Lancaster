<PRE>alt.support.Schizophrenia
From: <a href="mailto:mpereira@webtv.net">mpereira@webtv.net</a> (Michael A. Pereira)

     Mental patients should be lazy. Hey pigs! Don't ever call me a
&quot;good nut&quot;! I won't do an efn.org thing for you. If you force me to
slave for you , you can bet there'll be sabotage. I have a Doctorate in
Entropy and that is my life's vocation. I can undermine your system on
such a subtle level that it'll make your head spin. No, fellow
revolutionaries, dont't be useful; don't be used. 

Schizophrenia simply means &quot;scatter brained&quot; in Greek,

St. Hubbins (regarding the question, &quot;Is this the end of Spinal Tap?&quot;):
 &quot;Well, I don't really think that the end can be assessed as of itself as
being the end because what does the end feel like? It's like saying when
you try to extrapolate the end of the universe, you say, if the universe
is indeed infinite, then how-what does that mean? How far is all the way,
and then if it stops, what's stopping it, and what's behind what's
stopping it? So, what's the end, you know, is my question to you.&quot;

it affects your judgment.&quot;

&quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot;
Ramius (regarding the Red October): &quot;It reminds me of the heady days of
Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets.
Now they will tremble again-at the sound of our silence. The order is:
engage the silent drive.&quot;

&quot;Speed (motion picture).&quot;
SWAT officer (regarding a sabotaged elevator): &quot;Anything else that'll keep
this elevator from falling?&quot;
Traven: &quot;Yeah. The basement.&quot;

---------------------------------
Yin and Yang, opposite and complementary forces in Chinese thought,
from Chinese words meaning &quot;shaded&quot; and &quot;sunny.&quot; Beginning in the early
4th century BC Chinese philosophers wrote about yin and yang in terms of
the environment, especially the shaded and sunny sides of a hill. By the
end of that century yin became associated with everything dark, moist,
receptive, earthy, and female, whereas yang was bright, dry, active,
heavenly, and male. Yin and yang were believed to combine in various
proportions to produce all the different objects in the universe.
 There is always an element of yang within yin and an element of yin
within yang. Together they are symbolized by a circle divided into black
and white sections, with a dot of white in the black portion and a dot of
black in the white portion. This interaction indicates that the
characteristics of yin cannot exist without those of yang, nor the
characteristics of yang without yin. Chinese philosophers stressed the
importance of balance between the two to ensure social and political harmony. Rebellion, floods, and disease were 
said to be caused by an imbalance of yin and yang. Fortune-tellers and doctors in China and later in Japan advised 
governments and individuals on ways to restore harmony in relationship to yin and yang.

Black Friday the emergency service's nightmare Friday before Christmas.
What is 'Black Friday'? It's the apocalyptic code name for what's
expected to be the biggest drinking night of the year.

Black Friday, name applied to a short-lived financial crisis in the
United States that occurred on Friday, September 24, 1869. The panic was
precipitated when two financial speculators, James Fisk and Jay Gould,
attempted to corner the U.S. gold market. On September 20 they began
purchasing gold in New York City; by September 24 they controlled enough
of the available supply in the city to bid up the price from about 140 to
163y. This rapid increase in the price of gold threw the stock exchange
into confusion, and the prices of commodities fluctuated wildly

The name Black Friday has occasionally been applied also to the Friday of
September 19, 1873, when the New York Stock Exchange suffered a major
financial crash that ushered in the panic of 1873.

Britain did not rejoin after 16 September 1992 - a day which became known
as &quot;Black Wednesday&quot;.

October 29, 1929, known ever since as &quot;Black Tuesday&quot;, when the Wall Street
Crash of the New York Stock Exchange began the process that led to the
almost complete collapse of the world economic system, and was a major
factor in the cataclysmic world war that would follow a decade later
