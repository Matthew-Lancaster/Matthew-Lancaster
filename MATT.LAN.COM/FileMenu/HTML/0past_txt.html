months
------
this is the Gregorian calendar it is a 16th century adaptation of the Julian
calendar devised in the 1st century BC
-------
January    was named after Janus, the Roman god of gates and doors,
           and hence of openings and beginnings
February   Latin word februa, signifying the festivals of purification
           celebrated in ancient Rome during this month.
March      was named for mars God of war
April      name Aprilis, derived from aperire (&quot;to open&quot;),
           probably because it is the season when buds begin to open;
           it was called Eostre (Easter) month by the Anglo-Saxons.
           Playing tricks on the first day of April is a custom among
           European peoples. In France the victim of such practical jokes is
           called an April fish; in Scotland, a gowk or cuckoo;
           and in English-speaking countries, an April fool.
May        Since ancient times May 1 has been the occasion for various
           celebrations. In the United States, May Day, Memorial Day,
           and Mother's Day are celebrated in May
June       The etymology of the name is uncertain. Different authorities
           derive the name from the Roman goddess Juno or from the name of a
           Roman clan, Junius. Another theory traces the origin of the name to
           the Latin iuniores, as opposed to maiores for May, the two months
           being dedicated to youth and old age, respectively
July       thus was called Quintilis, or fifth month, by the Romans.
           It was the month in which Julius Caesar was born, and in 44 BC,
           the year of his assassination, the month was named Julius,
           in his honor.
August     Because it was the sixth month in the Roman year,
           which begins with March,
           it was originally named Sextilis (from Latin sextus,&quot;sixth&quot;).
           It was given its present name in honor of the emperorAugustus,
           for several of the most fortunate events of his life occurred
           during this month
September  named from the Latin word septem meaning seven.
October    was the eighth month latin &quot;octo&quot; for 8
November   N for november stands for N in NINE i think
December   was the tenth month (Latin decem,&quot;ten&quot;) in the Roman calendar,
           but the name was retained in the present reckoning.
           The Christmas season, culminating on December 25,
           has taken on some of the festal nature of the Saturnalia,
           a Roman holiday celebrated at this time of year,
           honoring the god Saturn. Kwanzaa, an African American festival
           and the Jewish holiday Hanukkah (in most years) also occur in
           December.

Planets of the solar system
Nine major planets are currently known.
They are commonly divided into two groups:
the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars)
and the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto).
The inner planets are small and are composed primarily of rock and iron.
The outer planets (except Pluto) are much larger and consist mainly of
hydrogen, helium, and ice.
-
Also sometimes Neptune is further away from the sun than Pluto coz of their
oval orbits are such way inclined
-
and now it seem there is a tenth planet named. &quot;Sedna&quot; after the Inuit goddess
of the ocean.
