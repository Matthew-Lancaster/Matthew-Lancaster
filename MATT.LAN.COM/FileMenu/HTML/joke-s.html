Blonde Joke<br>
<br>
A blind guy on a bar stool shouts to the bartender,<br>
&quot;Wanna hear a blonde joke?&quot;<br>
<br>
In a hushed voice, the guy next to him says,<br>
&quot;Before you tell that joke, you should know something.<br>
Our bartender IS blonde and the bouncer is blonde.<br>
I'm a 6' tall blonde, 200 lb black belt. The<br>
guy sitting next to me is a blonde, 6' 2, weighs<br>
225 and he's a rugby player. The fella to your<br>
right is 6' 5&quot; pushing 300 and he's a wrestler.<br>
Each one of US is blonde. Think about it, Mister.<br>
You still wanna tell that joke?&quot;<br>
<br>
The blind guy says, &quot;Nah, not if I'm gonna<br>
have to explain it five times.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial">A man was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his<br>
wife was a flirtatious sort with an extremely healthy sex drive,<br>
so he thought he'd buy her a little something to keep her occupied while<br>
he was gone.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
He went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He was<br>
browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please<br>
his wife ,and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He<br>
explained his situation<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The old man said, &quot;Well, We have vibrating dildos, special attachments,<br>
and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied<br>
for weeks, except---&quot;and he stopped<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Except what?&quot; the man asked.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Nothing, nothing.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;C'mon, tell me! I need something!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is The Voodoo<br>
Penis.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;So what's up with this Voodoo Penis?&quot; he asked.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out a very old<br>
wooden box, carved with strange symbols and erotic images. He&nbsp;<br>
 opened it, and there lay an ordinary-looking dildo<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The businessman laughed, and said &quot;Big damn deal. It looks like<br>
every other dildo in this shop!&quot;;<br>
The old man replied, &quot;But you haven't seen what it'll do<br>
yet.&quot; He pointed to a door and said, &quot;Voodoo Penis, the door.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Voodoo Penis miraculously<br>
rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started pounding<br>
the keyhole. The whole door shook wildly with the vibrations, so much<br>
so that a crack began to form down the middle.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Before the door split, the old man said &quot;Voodoo Penis, return<br>
back to the box and lay there quiet once more.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;I'll take it!&quot; said the businessman<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and<br>
that to use it, all she had to do was say &quot;Voodoo Penis, my<br>
crotch.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny<br>
and remembered the Voodoo Penis She undressed, opened the box<br>
and said,&quot; Voodoo Penis, my crotch!&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Voodoo Penis shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was<br>
absolutely incredible, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
After three mind-shattering orgasms, she became very exhausted<br>
and decided she'd had enough. She tried to pull it out, but it was<br>
stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it<br>
out, but nothing worked.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Worried, she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could<br>
help.\<br>
She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive,<br>
quivering with every thrust of the dildo&nbsp;<br>
On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve all over<br>
the road.<br>
A police officer saw this and immediately pulled her over. He<br>
asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Gasping and twitching, she explained, &quot;I haven't had anything to drink,<br>
officer. You see, I've got this Voodoo Penis thing stuck in my crotch<br>
and it won't stop screwing me!&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The officer looked at her for a second, shook his head and in an<br>
arrogant voice<br>
replied, &quot;Yeah, right... Voodoo Penis, my ass.&quot;...... The rest<br>
is<br>
history..............</font>

<p>Thought for the day*<br>
<br>
A man is driving down a road.<br>
A woman is driving down the same road from the opposite<br>
direction. As they pass each other, the woman leans out the window and<br>
yells &quot;PIG&quot;. The man immediately leans out his window and yells,<br>
BITCH!&quot; They each continue on their way, and as the man rounds the<br>
next curve, he crashes into a huge pig in the middle of the road and is<br>
killed.<br>

Three men died on Christmas Eve and were met by Saint Peter at<br>
the pearly gates.<br>
<br>
&quot;In honor of this holy season,&quot; Saint Peter said, &quot;you must each<br>
possess something that symbolizes Christmas to get into heaven.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first man fumbled through his pockets and pulled out a<br>
lighter. He flicked it on. &quot;It represents a candle&quot;, he<br>
said.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may pass through the pearly gates&quot;, Saint Peter said.<br>
<br>
The second man reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of<br>
keys. He shook them and said, &quot;They're bells&quot;.<br>
<br>
Saint Peter said &quot;You may pass through the pearly gates&quot;.<br>
The third man started searching desperately through his pockets<br>
and finally pulled out a pair of women's panties.<br>
<br>
St. Peter looked at the man with a raised eyebrow and asked, &quot;And just<br>
what do those symbolize?&quot;<br>
The man replied, &quot;They're Carols&quot;.</font></td>

        A man died and went to heaven. As he stood in front of St. Peter at<br>
the Pearly Gates, he saw a huge wall of clocks behind him.<br>
He asked, &quot;What are all those clocks?&quot;<br>
St. Peter answered, &quot;Those are Lie-Clocks.<br>
Everyone on Earth has a Lie-Clock.<br>
Every time you lie the hands on your clock will move.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; said the man, &quot;whose clock is that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's Mother Teresa's. The hands have never moved, indicating that she<br>
never told a lie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Incredible,&quot; said the man. &quot;And whose clock is that one?&quot;<br>
<br>
St. Peter responded, &quot;That's Abraham Lincoln's clock.<br>
The hands have moved twice, telling us that Abe told only two lies in<br>
his entire<br>
&nbsp;life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's President Bush's clock?&quot; asked the man.<br>
&quot;Bush's clock is in Jesus' office.<br>
He's using it as a ceiling fan</td>

The Psychiatrist was escorting a patient from one Psychiatric Hospital to
another. They were travelling by train, and the Psychiatrist was intrigued to
see the patient tearing up bits of paper and throwing them out of the window.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you doing that for?&quot; asked the Psychiatrist.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's to keep the elephants away !&quot; answered the patient.<br>
<br>
&quot;But there are no elephants in Surrey,&quot; pointed out the Psychiatrist.<br>
<br>
&quot;Effective, isn't it?&quot; was the logical answer.<br>
