In the opening of the poem, Dante finds himself lost in a dark wood, which symbolizes his deviation from righteous living. While attempting to get his bearings, Dante spots a shining hill, which he calls the Mount of Joy. He begins to climb, but beasts, such as the she-wolf of unrestraint and the lion of ambition, block his way.

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">from the straight road and woke to find myself</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">alone in a dark wood. How shall I say</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">what wood that was! I never saw so drear,</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">so rank, so arduous a wilderness!</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">Its very memory gives a shape to fear.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">Death could scarce be more bitter than that place!</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">But since it came to good, I will recount</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">all that I found revealed there by God's grace.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">How I came to it I cannot rightly say,</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">so drugged and loose with sleep had I become</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">when I first wandered there from the True Way.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">But at the far end of that valley of evil</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">whose maze had sapped my very heart with fear</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">I found myself before a little hill</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">and lifted up my eyes. Its shoulders glowed</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">already with the sweet rays of that planet</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">whose virtue leads men straight on every road,</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">and the shining strengthened me against the fright</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">whose agony had wracked the lake of my heart</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">through all the terrors of that piteous night.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">Just as a swimmer, who with his last breath</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">flounders ashore from perilous seas, might turn</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">to memorize the wide water of his death—</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">so did I turn, my soul still fugitive</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">from death's surviving image, to stare down</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">that pass that none had ever left alive.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">And there I lay to rest from my heart's race</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">till calm and breath returned to me. Then rose</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">and pushed up that dead slope at such a pace</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">each footfall rose above the last. And lo!</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">almost at the beginning of the rise</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">I faced a spotted Leopard, all tremor and flow</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">and gaudy pelt. And it would not pass, but stood</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">so blocking my every turn that time and again</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">I was on the verge of turning back to the wood.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">This fell at the first widening of the dawn</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">as the sun was climbing Aries with those stars</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">that rode with him to light the new creation.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">Thus the holy hour and the sweet season</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">of commemoration did much to arm my fear</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">of that bright murderous beast with their good omen.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">Yet not so much but what I shook with dread</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">at sight of a great Lion that broke upon me</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">raging with hunger, its enormous head</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">held high as if to strike a mortal terror</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">into the very air. And down his track,</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">a She-Wolf drove upon me, a starved horror</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">ravening and wasted beyond all belief.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">She seemed a rack for avarice, gaunt and craving.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">Oh many the souls she has brought to endless grief!</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">She brought such heaviness upon my spirit</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">at sight of her savagery and desperation,</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">I died from every hope of that high summit.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">And like a miser—eager in acquisition</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">but desperate in self-reproach when Fortune's wheel</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">turns to the hour of his loss—all tears and attrition</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">I wavered back; and still the beast pursued,</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">till I slid back into the sunless wood.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">And as I fell to my soul's ruin, a presence</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">gathered before me on the discolored air,</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">the figure of one who seemed hoarse from long silence.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" SIZE=1 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">By Thucydides</FONT> </P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">‘I have no wish to make a long speech on subjects familiar to you all: so I shall say nothing about the warlike deeds by which we acquired our power or the battles in which we or our fathers gallantly resisted our enemies, Greek or foreign. What I want to do is, in the first place, to discuss the spirit in which we faced our trials and also our constitution and the way of life which has made us great. After that I shall speak in praise of the dead, believing that this kind of speech is not inappropriate to the present occasion, and that this whole assembly, of citizens and foreigners, may listen to it with advantage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">‘Let me say that our system of government does not copy the institutions of our neighbours. It is more the case of our being a model to others, than of our imitating anyone else. Our constitution is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of a minority but of the whole people. When it is a question of settling private disputes, everyone is equal before the law; when it is a question of putting one person before another in positions of public responsibility, what counts is not membership of a particular class, but the actual ability which the man possesses. No one, so long as he has it in him to be of service to the state, is kept in political obscurity because of poverty. And, just as our political life is free and open, so is our day-to-day life in our relations with each other. We do not get into a state with our next-door neighbour if he enjoys himself in his own way, nor do we give him the kind of black looks which, though they do no real harm, still do hurt people's feelings. We are free and tolerant in our private lives; but in public affairs we keep to the law. This is because it commands our deep respect.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">‘We give our obedience to those whom we put in positions of authority, and we obey the laws themselves, especially those which are for the protection of the oppressed, and those unwritten laws which it is an acknowledged shame to break.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">‘And here is another point. When our work is over, we are in a position to enjoy all kinds of recreation for our spirits. There are various kinds of contests and sacrifices regularly throughout the year; in our own homes we find a beauty and a good taste which delight us every day and which drive away our cares. Then the greatness of our city brings it about that all the good things from all over the world flow in to us, so that to us it seems just as natural to enjoy foreign goods as our own local products.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">‘Then there is a great difference between us and our opponents, in our attitude towards military security. Here are some examples: Our city is open to the world, and we have no periodical deportations in order to prevent people observing or finding out secrets which might be of military advantage to the enemy. This is because we rely, not on secret weapons, but on our own real courage and loyalty. There is a difference, too, in our educational systems. The Spartans, from their earliest boyhood, are submitted to the most laborious training in courage; we pass our lives without all these restrictions, and yet are just as ready to face the same dangers as they are. Here is a proof of this: When the Spartans invade our land, they do not come by themselves, but bring all their allies with them; whereas we, when we launch an attack abroad, do the job by ourselves, and, though fighting on foreign soil, do not often fail to defeat opponents who are fighting for their own hearths and homes. As a matter of fact none of our enemies has ever yet been confronted with our total strength, because we have to divide our attention between our navy and the many missions on which our troops are sent on land. Yet, if our enemies engage a detachment of our forces and defeat it, they give themselves credit for having thrown back our entire army; or, if they lose, they claim that they were beaten by us in full strength. There are certain advantages, I think, in our way of meeting danger voluntarily, with an easy mind, instead of with a laborious training, with natural rather than with state-induced courage. We do not have to spend our time practising to meet sufferings which are still in the future; and when they are actually upon us we show ourselves just as brave as these others who are always in strict training. This is one point in which, I think, our city deserves to be admired. There are also others:</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">‘Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not make us soft. We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as something to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it: the real shame is in not taking practical measures to escape from it. Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs but in the affairs of the state as well: even those who are mostly occupied with their own business are extremely well-informed on general politics—this is a peculiarity of ours: we do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all. We Athenians, in our own persons, take our decisions on policy or submit them to proper discussions: for we do not think that there is an incompatibility between words and deeds; the worst thing is to rush into action before the consequences have been properly debated. And this is another point where we differ from other people. We are capable at the same time of taking risks and of estimating them beforehand. Others are brave out of ignorance; and, when they stop to think, they begin to fear. But the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who best knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">‘Again, in questions of general good feeling there is a great contrast between us and most other people. We make friends by doing good to others, not by receiving good from them. This makes our friendship all the more reliable, since we want to keep alive the gratitude of those who are in our debt by showing continued goodwill to them: whereas the feelings of one who owes us something lack the same enthusiasm, since he knows that, when he repays our kindness, it will be more like paying back a debt than giving something spontaneously. We are unique in this. When we do kindnesses to others, we do not do them out of any calculations of profit or loss: we do them without afterthought, relying on our free liberality. Taking everything together then, I declare that our city is an education to Greece, and I declare that in my opinion each single one of our citizens, in all the manifold aspects of life, is able to show himself the rightful lord and owner of his own person, and do this, moreover, with exceptional grace and exceptional versatility. And to show that this is no empty boasting for the present occasion, but real tangible fact, you have only to consider the power which our city possesses and which has been won by those very qualities which I have mentioned. Athens, alone of the states we know, comes to her testing time in a greatness that surpasses what was imagined of her. In her case, and in her case alone, no invading enemy is ashamed at being defeated, and no subject can complain of being governed by people unfit for their responsibilities. Mighty indeed are the marks and monuments of our empire which we have left. Future ages will wonder at us, as the present age wonders at us now. We do not need the praises of a Homer, or of anyone else whose words may delight us for the moment, but whose estimation of facts will fall short of what is really true. For our adventurous spirit has forced an entry into every sea and into every land; and everywhere we have left behind us everlasting memorials of good done to our friends or suffering inflicted on our enemies.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Serif">‘This then, is the kind of city for which these men, who could not bear the thought of losing her, nobly fought and nobly died. It is only natural that every one of us who survive them should be willing to undergo hardships in her service. And it was for this reason that I have spoken at such length about our city, because I wanted to make it clear that for us there is more at stake than there is for others who lack our advantages; also I wanted my words of praise for the dead to be set in the bright light of evidence. And now the most important of these words has been spoken. I have sung the praises of our city; but it was the courage and gallantry of these men, and of people like them, which made her splendid. Nor would you find it true in the case of many of the Greeks, as it is true of them, that no words can do more than justice to their deeds.</FONT></P>

The name Regulus is a Latin version of the star’s Greek name, Basiliscus, which means “The Little King” and reflects the lion’s status as the king of beasts. In ancient times, Regulus was the brightest star directly over the Mediterranean latitudes at the time of the summer solstice, and so it became known to astronomers and astrologers of these areas as the king of the stars. Because of a slow wobble in the earth’s axis of rotation known as precession, however, Regulus no longer occupies this position in the summer sky. It is now visible in the evening sky throughout both the northern and southern hemispheres from February to June.

For comparison, the most distant easily seen stars are up to 5000 light-years from the earth. The primary star in the Regulus binary system, Regulus A, is a brilliant bluish-white star shining with intrinsic luminosity, or total light output, that rates an absolute</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">magnitude</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> of -0.9 (bright stars have low or even negative magnitude values). This magnitude corresponds to the light output of about 140 suns. At its distance from the earth, Regulus A shines in the night sky with an apparent magnitude—a measure of how bright it appears to an observer on the earth—of +1.4, making it one of the 25 brightest stars as seen from the earth. Regulus A’s companion star, Regulus B, is a much smaller, dimmer, and cooler star that shines at an apparent magnitude of +7.7, making it too faint to see with unaided eyes. Regulus B is orbited by an even fainter star shining with an apparent magnitude of +13, which is beyond the range of most amateur telescopes. Regulus is actually, therefore, a triple star system. The combined brightness of the system gives it an apparent magnitude of +1.35.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Blair, Tony</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1953- ), prime minister of the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">United Kingdom</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1997- ). Born Anthony Charles Lynton Blair, he was educated at schools in Durham, England, and Edinburgh, Scotland. He then studied law at St. John’s College in Oxford, England, before becoming a lawyer specializing in trade union and industrial law in 1976.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Blair began his political career in 1983, when he was elected to Parliament as a member of the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Labour Party</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. He quickly advanced to the party’s front ranks during the Conservative administration of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990), when Labour was the major opposition party. He was favored by Labour leaders</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Neil Kinnock</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> and John Smith; they believed his more moderate positions would appeal to British voters, who, beginning in the 1979 general elections, had started to turn away from Labour and its pro-trade union policies. From 1984 to 1987 Blair was opposition spokesman on treasury and economic affairs. He then moved to various posts in the Departments of Trade and Industry (1987), Energy (1988-1989), and Employment (1989-1992). In 1992 he was promoted again, taking charge of domestic issues in the Labour Party’s counterpart to the governing Conservatives’ cabinet.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">After party leader John Smith died in May 1994, Blair was chosen to take his place. Almost immediately, Blair began working to make the party more mainstream, lessening its dependence on labor and trade unions and broadening the party’s membership. In 1995 and 1996 the “New Labour” party, as Blair called it, rapidly gained in popularity, while at the same time a long economic recession and several scandals drastically reduced support for the Conservatives.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">This rise in popularity culminated in a landslide victory for Blair and the Labour Party in the May 1997 general elections. Labour had its best showing in the history of the party, garnering almost 45 percent of the vote and coming away with 419 seats and a 179-seat majority in the 659-seat House of Commons.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Blair became the youngest prime minister in almost 200 years. After taking office, Blair pledged to abide by federal spending limits and programs established by the Conservatives. At the same time, he launched ambitious new programs, calling for better relations with the European Union (EU), separate parliaments for Scotland and Wales, and reforms in welfare and health care.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">One of Blair’s first accomplishments as prime minister was to stimulate the faltering peace talks in Northern Ireland. Soon after taking office he laid out a new timeline for the talks. In October 1997 Blair met with</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Sinn Fein</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> leader</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Gerry Adams</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, the first time in 76 years a British prime minister had met with a Sinn Fein leader. The peace talks were successfully concluded in April 1998, and referendums to approve the peace plan were voted on the following month in Northern Ireland and Ireland.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In his first year as prime minister, Blair supported referendums that were passed in Scotland and Wales to devolve powers from the British Parliament to a Scottish parliament and a Welsh assembly. Blair and his party were highly criticized for a welfare reform plan to cut benefits to single parents. However, they were praised for a welfare-to-work program for jobless youths that placed many unemployed in jobs.</FONT> </P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Blair was an important advisor to the royal family after the death of</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Princess Diana</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> in August 1997. The British people, grief-stricken by the tragedy of Diana’s death, criticized the royal family for their aloofness and lack of public presence. Blair helped convince Queen Elizabeth II to hold a public funeral and to become a more visible symbol to Britons.</FONT><SUP>15</SUP></P><B>Major, John</B> <BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Major, John</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1943- ), British politician and prime minister of</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">the United Kingdom</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1990-1997). Atypically for a Conservative Party leader, Major was born into a working-class family in London and left school at the age of 16. He worked as a banker for nearly two decades until elected to Parliament in 1979. A protégé of</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Margaret Thatcher</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, he rose rapidly through the ranks, serving as foreign secretary (1989) and chancellor of the Exchequer (1989-1990) before succeeding Thatcher as prime minister and party leader in November 1990. Like Thatcher, he maintained excellent relations with the United States and wholeheartedly supported the U.S.-led effort to expel Iraq from Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War (1991), but he expressed a greater willingness than she did to commit Britain to political and economic integration with Europe.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">He led the Conservatives to victory in a hard-fought parliamentary election in April 1992. Major’s government then faced a growing financial crisis compounded by high inflation and unemployment, and a nationwide recession. As a result, Major’s approval rating dropped to 14 percent, the lowest of any prime minister in British history. In July 1995, in an attempt to solidify his party, Major resigned as leader of the Conservatives, forcing an election for a new leader. Major won again, but one-third of the party voted against him or abstained. In April 1996 the Conservatives suffered a huge loss at the polls to the opposition</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Labour Party</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, headed by</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Tony Blair</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. This loss trimmed the Conservative majority to just one seat. Despite Major’s efforts to increase Conservative popularity and to solidify his party, support continued to wane. In May 1997 Major and the Conservatives were soundly defeated by the Labour Party in national elections. After this defeat, Major announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Major’s major achievement in office was the establishment of a peaceful dialogue with the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Irish Republican Army</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (IRA). Talks with Irish prime minister</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Albert Reynolds</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> in 1993 led to an IRA cease-fire in August 1994. Negotiations later stalled and the IRA resumed violence in February 1996, but a framework for the peace process had been established. Although talks were scheduled to resume in June 1997, progress depended on the IRA’s willingness to restore their cease-fire before negotiations could begin.</FONT><SUP>16</SUP></P><B>Thatcher, Margaret Hilda</B> <BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Thatcher, Margaret Hilda</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, (1925-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">&#8195;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">), first woman to hold the office of prime minister of the United Kingdom (1979-1990). She was born Margaret Hilda Roberts in Grantham and educated at the University of Oxford, where she earned degrees in chemistry; from 1947&nbsp; to 1951 she worked as a research chemist. She married Denis Thatcher in 1951. In 1953, having studied for the bar, she became a tax lawyer. Joining the Conservative party, Thatcher was elected to the House of Commons in 1959. As minister of education and science from 1970&nbsp; to 1974 under</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Edward Heath</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, she provoked a storm of protest by abolishing free milk in the schools. After the Conservative defeat in 1974, she challenged Heath for the leadership of the party and won the post in 1975. Four years later she led the party to victory, vowing to reverse Britain's economic decline and to reduce the role of government. In 1982&nbsp; Argentine forces occupied the nearby</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Falkland Islands</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, which were claimed by both Argentina and the United Kingdom. Thatcher's government sent a task force to the Falklands that defeated the Argentines. Bolstered by the success of her Falkland Islands policy, Thatcher led the Conservatives to a sweeping victory in the parliamentary elections of June 1983. In October 1984 she narrowly escaped injury when a bomb planted by Irish extremists exploded in Brighton's Grand Hotel during a party conference. Victorious in the June 1987&nbsp; elections, she became the first British prime minister in the 20th century to serve three consecutive terms. During Thatcher's years as prime minister, unemployment rose, almost doubling in her first term. Thatcher opposed the socialist programs of the Labour party and worked to decrease the role of the government in the economy. She privatized some nationalized industries and social programs, including education, housing, and health care. In 1990 controversy over Thatcher's tax policy and over her reluctance to commit the United Kingdom to full economic integration with Europe inspired a strong challenge to her leadership. She resigned in November and was succeeded as party leader and prime minister by her protégé,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">John Major</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">.</FONT><SUP>17</SUP></P><B>Callaghan, James</B> <BR>

He served in the Royal Navy during World War II and was elected to Parliament for the Labour Party in 1945. Callaghan was chancellor of the Exchequer (1964-1967), home secretary (1967-1970), and foreign secretary (1974-1976) in the two governments headed by Harold Wilson, and he succeeded Wilson as party leader and prime minister in 1976. Inheriting a severely troubled economy and a slender majority in Parliament, he depended on support from the Liberals and (after 1978) the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP). His government, destabilized by labor unrest and deserted by the SNP, fell to the Conservative onslaught led by Margaret Thatcher in 1979. He resigned as party leader in 1980.</FONT><SUP>18</SUP></P><B>Wilson, Harold, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx</B> <BR>

Wilson became a lecturer in economics at Oxford in 1937 at the age of 21. During World War II, he served in several government departments. He was elected to Parliament in 1945 as Labour party member for Ormskirk, Lancashire. In 1947 he became a member of the Privy Council; he was president of the board of trade from 1947 until 1951.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In 1963 Wilson was elected leader of the Labour party. In 1964, when his party gained a slim majority in Parliament, he became prime minister, remaining in office until the Conservatives won the general election in 1970. As prime minister, Wilson attempted, with mixed results, to bolster Britain's weak economy by reducing overseas expenditures and by devaluing the pound sterling in 1967. He also tried to mediate an end to the war in Vietnam and to moderate the policies of the white-minority regime in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), which unilaterally declared itself independent in 1965. In each case, however, he was unsuccessful.</FONT></P>

In April 1976 he unexpectedly retired as prime minister but retained his seat in Parliament. He was succeeded as prime minister by fellow Labourite James Callaghan.

Attlee was born in London and educated at University College, University of Oxford. He began his career as a social-service worker and lawyer and from 1913 to 1922 was a tutor and lecturer in social science at the London School of Economics. During this period he became one of the leaders of the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Labour Party</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, and after 1922 he represented the borough of Stepney, London, in Parliament. From 1935 to 1940, as the head of his party, he was leader of the opposition in Parliament. In the coalition cabinets organized during World War II, Attlee served under Prime Minister</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Winston Churchill</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> in various posts, including those of lord privy seal, secretary of state for the dominions, lord president of the council, and deputy prime minister. In 1945 he succeeded Churchill as prime minister in a surprising landslide victory. He began to carry out the program of the Labour Party, which included nationalizing the iron and steel industry, the railroads, and the coal mines. He also worked for comprehensive social welfare programs such as nationalizing health care, improving education, and rebuilding housing destroyed by the war. India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and Burma (now known as Myanmar) were granted independence. After the Conservative Party won the 1951 elections, Attlee again became the leader of the opposition in Parliament. He resigned as Labour Party head and member of Parliament in 1955.

During this long political career, Churchill held every important cabinet office in the British government, except foreign minister.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Churchill was born at Blenheim Palace, his family's ancestral seat in</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Oxfordshire</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, on November 30, 1874. He was the elder son of Lord</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Randolph Henry Spencer Churchill</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, a British statesman who rose to be chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of the House of Commons. His mother was an American, Jennie Jerome, the daughter of a New York financier. Churchill inherited a family tradition of statesmanship that went back to the great English general</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">John Churchill</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, the 1st Duke of Marlborough, in the 17th century. Young Winston attended</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Harrow School</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, on the outskirts of London, where he was schooled in the classics. He was a precocious student and, like his father, had a remarkable memory, but he was also stubborn. Churchill had little interest in learning Latin, Greek, or mathematics. By his own account, he considered himself such a dunce that he &quot;could learn only English.&quot; However, he said, &quot;I learned it thoroughly.&quot;</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">From early childhood Churchill was fascinated by soldiers and warfare, and he often played with the large collection of lead soldiers in his nursery. His later years at Harrow were spent preparing to enter the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, from which he graduated with honors. Early in 1895 his father died; Churchill was only 20 years old. A few weeks later Churchill was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, a regiment of the British army.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In November 1895 Churchill spent his first military leave on assignment for a London newspaper. He traveled to Cuba in order to accompany the Spanish army, which was then attempting to stop a rebellion. On his 21st birthday, which he spent in the Cuban jungle, he came under fire for the first time. Later, after his regiment was sent to India in 1896, he secured a temporary transfer to the turbulent North-West Frontier, where a tribal insurrection was under way. Churchill's dispatches to the</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Daily Telegraph</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> newspaper in 1897 formed the basis for his first book,</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The Story of the Malakand Field Force</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1898).</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In 1898 Churchill went to Egypt attached to the 21st Lancers and took part in the reconquest of the Sudan. This area south of Egypt had been controlled by Egypt prior to 1885, when it fell to a rebel Muslim group. As Britain gained control of Egypt in the 1880s and 1890s, it sought to reclaim the Sudan. During the Battle of Omdurman in September 1898, Churchill participated in one of the last cavalry charges in British military history. Again his newspaper dispatches were followed by a book,</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The River War</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1899) in two volumes, the most substantial work he wrote before entering Parliament.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Churchill resigned his army commission in 1899 and turned to journalism and politics.

He was captured by the Boers and imprisoned at the State Model School in Pretoria. He managed to escape from prison and then take the railroad into Portuguese East Africa, a feat that made him a national hero. He then returned to South Africa and sought another army commission. He fought and wrote about the war until he returned to London in the summer of 1900.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">When Churchill returned to England in 1900, his South African exploits had made him famous, and he was elected to the House of Commons. Though he was a Conservative, he criticized military spending and supported free trade, which soon resulted in a conflict with the Conservative leadership, who supported large military budgets and protective tariffs. In 1904 he &quot;crossed the floor of the House&quot; to take a seat with the Liberal Party.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Churchill also continued writing. His political ambition was evident in his sole novel,</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Savrola</FONT></I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">(1900), in which the hero leads a democratic revolution in an imaginary country in the Balkans, only to see the revolution escape from his control.

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">After the Liberals won the election in 1905, Churchill was appointed undersecretary at the Colonial Office, where he was the minister responsible for issues concerning Britain’s colonies.

In 1908 he gained his first cabinet post as president of the Board of Trade. That same year, Churchill married Clementine Ogilvy Hozier. They had five children, one of whom died as a young child. In 1910 Churchill became home secretary, with responsibility for police and the prison system. He held this post until 1911, superintending liberal reforms of Britain's prison system to reduce lengthy terms, to find alternatives to prison for youthful offenders, and to distinguish between criminal and political prisoners.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In the years prior to</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">World War I</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1914-1918), economic and political tensions grew among Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. The British government was concerned about the buildup of the German navy and believed that war was inevitable. In 1911 Prime Minister</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Herbert Henry Asquith</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> made Churchill first lord of the admiralty, with a mandate to create a naval war staff and to maintain the fleet in constant readiness for war. Churchill threw himself into this task, developing heavier guns, faster battleships, and naval aviation.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">As war clouds gathered in July 1914, Churchill conducted a test mobilization of the fleet. When the test was over, he ordered the fleet to remain concentrated in readiness. That decision meant that Britain was prepared to act quickly when the war broke out. On July 28, after Austria declared war on Serbia, the fleet proceeded to its war station at</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Scapa Flow</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, Britain's principal naval base, located in the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Orkney Islands</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> in northern Scotland. Within days, Britain joined the growing international conflict. Throughout the war, the navy's presence in the North Sea dominated and contained the German fleet.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In September 1914, distressed at the rapid deterioration of Belgian resistance to the German invasion, Churchill rushed to Belgium to help save the critical port city of Antwerp. He was unable to save the city, but his intervention stiffened Belgian resolve and slowed the German advance until Allied lines became firmer. This reduced the threat to Britain and saved some territory from coming under German control. During this time, Churchill realized that barbed wire and machine guns were not sufficient tools to break the stalemate on the western front and he worked on developing armored fighting vehicles (tanks) to break the deadlock and end the slaughter.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">As the lines hardened on the western front, Churchill focused on a campaign to force open the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Dardanelles</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> Strait, controlled by the Ottoman Empire, to give the Allies a direct route to Russia through the Black Sea. Such a move would bring much-needed supplies to the Russian armies and eliminate the Ottomans from the war. When the naval attack faltered early in 1915, Churchill agreed to the War Office plan proposed by</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Horatio Herbert Kitchener</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> for a land campaign at the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Gallipoli</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> Peninsula on the Dardanelles. However, delays, hesitations, and incompetent leadership in the field robbed the campaign of success, and the Allies suffered great losses. Although the attack was one of the few brilliant strategic ideas of the war, Churchill’s cabinet colleagues withdrew their support for the idea as soon as Britain met resistance, letting Churchill take the blame as scapegoat. Churchill later concluded that, since he was not the prime minister, he had been wrong to make himself responsible for the attack without having full power to carry it out himself.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Because of the ill-starred Dardanelles campaign, Churchill was demoted from the admiralty in May 1915 and given a minor cabinet post. It was the greatest reverse to date in his political career, and Churchill was filled with despair. His wife later told his biographer Martin Gilbert, &quot;I thought he would die of grief.&quot; In the difficult months that followed his demotion, he began to paint, a hobby that brought him pleasure for more than four decades.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In November 1916 Churchill resigned his cabinet post and was given command of an infantry battalion in France.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">After World War I ended in 1918, Churchill was appointed to the War Office and then to the Colonial Office. However, in 1922, when the Conservatives returned to power, he was defeated at the polls and was out of the House of Commons for the first time since 1900.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Churchill busied himself with writing</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The World Crisis</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1923-1931), his five-volume account of World War I.

Churchill made three unsuccessful attempts to reenter the House of Commons, all the while edging carefully toward a return to the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Conservative Party</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. He finally won reelection in 1924, as a Conservative, and for the next 40 years was never without a seat in the House of Commons. Prime Minister</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Stanley Baldwin</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> offered Churchill the important cabinet post of chancellor of the Exchequer (national finance minister), which he held for the next five years.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">During the 1930s, when he held no cabinet posts, Churchill lived at his countryseat at Chartwell in Kent and supervised a literary factory of secretaries and assistants who helped him write hundreds of newspaper articles and several more books. He wrote his autobiography</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">My Early Life</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1930), which he called &quot;a story of youthful endeavour,&quot; and two books of essays,</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Thoughts and Adventures</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1932) and</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Great Contemporaries</FONT></I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">(1937).

<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">As Churchill studied his forebear's work in building and maintaining an alliance against the French king Louis XIV in the early 18th century, he turned his attention to current politics and became one of the most forceful and steady critics of the government. He organized opposition to the plan to grant self-government to India, an unpopular stance at a time when the British people wanted relief from the burdens of empire. Later, he concentrated his efforts on opposing the dangerous rise of German military power under the Nazi regime of</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Adolf Hitler</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. Because most Britons, as well as the government, were focused on domestic affairs, Churchill's warnings about Hitler went unheeded. When Baldwin became prime minister again in 1935, Churchill was not given a cabinet post.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">During the late 1930s Churchill’s national popularity declined. In 1936 Churchill was a loyal supporter of King</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Edward VIII</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> in the controversy surrounding the king's romance with the American Wallis Warfield Simpson, which led to his abdicating the throne. This support cost Churchill heavily in public opinion and further divided Churchill from Prime Minister Baldwin, who was pressing the king to abdicate. At the same time, he continued his unpopular warnings about Germany and Hitler: His newspaper columns were translated into many languages and widely published in Europe, then gathered into a book called</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Step by Step</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1939).</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In 1937 Neville Chamberlain became prime minister, and one year later Churchill denounced Chamberlain's</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Munich Pact</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, which ceded part of Czechoslovakia to Hitler. Meanwhile, Churchill worked on secret government committees performing defense research. From various informants he pieced together information about German intentions and capabilities—particularly about the growing strength of the German air force, or Luftwaffe, which posed a direct threat to Britain. He also encouraged the development of</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">radar</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, which helped the country detect activity in the sea or air.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">World War II broke out in September 1939 when Germany marched into Poland. Britain and France responded to the invasion of Poland by declaring war on Germany. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the United States joined the British and French war effort in 1941. Chamberlain invited Churchill to become a member of his war cabinet. Churchill was again first lord of the admiralty, and during the next eight months he did his best to build up the navy, especially in the field of antisubmarine warfare.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In 1940 the German attack on Norway ended public confidence in Chamberlain. On May 10, the day the Germans launched their surprise invasion of Holland and Belgium, Chamberlain resigned, and King George VI asked Churchill to be prime minister. Labour and Liberal leaders readily agreed to join Conservatives in a wartime coalition government. Churchill set the tone of his leadership in his first report to the House of Commons, &quot;I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.&quot; It was only the first of his stirring wartime speeches, which knit the country together and inspired people around the world.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The story of Churchill's life for the next five years is an integral part of the history of World War II. He was national commander in chief, with direct control over the formulation of policy and the conduct of military operations. He supervised every aspect of the war effort. His first concern was to create the administrative machinery for the central direction of the war. He set up a small personal staff of officers who also served on the war cabinet secretariat, so that there was a close working relationship between the war cabinet of ministers directly responsible for the conduct of the war and the new office of the minister of defense, which Churchill held himself.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Churchill took office just as Hitler's armored legions were breaking into France. It soon became clear the French would not be able to withstand the German assault. The French begged Churchill to send fighter squadrons to help them, but Churchill decided that even those squadrons would not be enough to save the French. In one of his hardest decisions, he turned down the French request in order to preserve the planes needed for Britain's own air defense.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In mid-June Churchill flew to France. He presented a radical plan to unite France and Britain under one government with a combined military, but the French refused it. On June 22 France surrendered to Germany. Since Churchill could not risk having French warships added to the German and Italian navies, he asked the French admiral to join the British fleet or to let his ships be demobilized. When the admiral refused, the British sank or disabled the French ships and seized any French ships in British-controlled ports.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">After the fall of France, the Germans planned to mount a massive air assault against Britain, followed by invasion. When the Battle of Britain began in 1940, the Royal Air Force suffered heavy losses, but managed to turn back the powerful German air force. During the German bombing raids on London, Churchill spent as much time as he could among its stricken citizens.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Soon after becoming prime minister, Churchill wrote to U.S. President</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Franklin D. Roosevelt</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> expressing Britain's need for destroyers and aircraft. Roosevelt was able to send older destroyers and to sell arms to Britain during the first year of the war, despite the United States’s declared neutrality. After March 1941 the United States supplied military and economic aid to Britain through the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">lend-lease</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> program; this support relieved Britain of some of the vast strain on her financial resources.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In 1941 Germany invaded the USSR, and although Churchill had always opposed the Communist regime, he offered to help Soviet leader</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Joseph Stalin</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. This meant diverting vital American weapons to a country that might fall to the Germans. However, Churchill believed that even if the Soviet armies were driven back to the Ural Mountains &quot;Russia would still exert an immense and ultimately decisive force,&quot; and he did not hesitate to put his belief into action by sending supplies.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In August 1941 Churchill and Roosevelt met for the first time during the war. This meeting was the first of many historic conferences between them, and from it emerged the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Atlantic Charter</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> declaring mutual support between the United States and Britain. When the United States entered the war in December 1941 after the Japanese attack on</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Pearl Harbor</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, Churchill and Roosevelt agreed to concentrate on defeating Hitler in Europe. They would maintain a defensive position in the war against Japan until they could increase their naval presence in the Pacific Ocean. The two leaders jointly headed the Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) that was set up to direct the war.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">For a time Roosevelt generally adopted Churchill's strategic ideas, such as the prime minister's insistence on invading North Africa in 1942 instead of a cross-channel assault. After 1943, however, as the United States became more powerful, Churchill was increasingly forced to accept American-imposed war plans. In early 1945, during the last months of Roosevelt’s life, the U.S. president ignored Churchill's warnings concerning Stalin's ambitions to take over countries in eastern Europe. Roosevelt wanted to work with Stalin for a peaceful postwar order and seemed more concerned about the waning British Empire than the growing prospect of a Soviet empire. World War II ended in 1945, first in Europe in May when the Germans surrendered to the Allied powers, and then in the Pacific in August.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">British general elections, postponed during the war, were held in July 1945. The wartime coalition government had broken apart after the defeat of Germany, and Churchill ran in the election as a Conservative. The results were announced while Churchill was attending the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Potsdam Conference</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, the last conference between the United States, Britain, and the USSR. Given Churchill's popularity as wartime leader, he did not expect to be defeated. Churchill himself was reelected, but the Labour Party gained a majority in Parliament because the British public opinion sought social and economic reforms that the Conservatives had resisted. The electorate did not wish to return to the slump and unemployment of the 1930s; they also blamed the Conservatives for waiting too long to resist Hitler.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Churchill's place at the Potsdam Conference was taken over by the new prime minister, Labour leader</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Clement Richard Attlee</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. Churchill retired as prime minister in deep disappointment. When his wife suggested that his party's defeat might prove to be a blessing in disguise, he replied that, if so, it was certainly well disguised.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">After the Labour victory, Churchill began rebuilding the shattered fabric of his party as leader of the opposition. He delivered a series of speeches that encouraged Anglo-American solidarity and the unity of Western Europe against the growing Communist threat. In 1946, in a speech at Fulton, Missouri, he defined the barrier thrown up by the USSR around the nations of eastern Europe as the &quot;iron curtain.&quot; He began to write his six-volume work,</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The Second World War</FONT></I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">(1948-1954), a comprehensive first-person account of his wartime statesmanship.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In 1951 Churchill's efforts to revitalize the Conservative Party were rewarded, and he again became prime minister. He worked to reduce the danger of nuclear warfare, vainly seeking a summit conference between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. In 1953 Queen Elizabeth II conferred on him the Knighthood of the Garter, and he became Sir Winston Churchill. In the same year he won the Nobel Prize for literature for his historical and biographical works and for his oratory. In November 1954, on Churchill's 80th birthday, the House of Commons honored him on the eve of his retirement. In April 1955 he resigned as prime minister but remained a member of the House of Commons.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In his retirement, Churchill worked on completing</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">A History of the English-Speaking Peoples</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (1956-1958), a four-volume work begun in the late 1930s but postponed during World War II. He devoted much of his leisure in his later years to his favorite pastime of painting, ultimately producing more than 500 canvases. The Royal Academy of Arts featured his works in 1959. In 1963 the U.S. Congress made Churchill an honorary citizen of the United States. Churchill died peacefully at his town house in London, two months after his 90th birthday. Following a state funeral service that was attended by dozens of world leaders at Saint Paul’s Cathedral, he was buried near Blenheim Palace.</FONT></P>

In the last decades of his life, Britain had virtually dismantled her empire. Many felt Churchill's passing represented the end of Britain's status as a world power and his funeral marked the end of British imperial glory.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Today some Britons regard Churchill as a disturbing emblem of the old regime of class privilege and colonial empire. Others admire his efforts to adapt the British tradition of self-government, liberty, civility, and the rule of law to a new world made by democracy and science in the 20th century. Churchill once wrote that &quot;a man's life must be nailed to a cross either of thought or of action.&quot; His own choice was clearly the active life of politics and, at its climax, he led his country in its &quot;finest hour.&quot;</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">British memorials to Churchill include the establishment of Churchill College at Cambridge University, which houses Churchill’s papers, and a prominent statue across from the Houses of Parliament in London. His story is told in the official biography begun by his son Randolph and completed by Martin Gilbert—the longest biography ever written about anyone. Millions have toured his birthplace at Blenheim Palace, his house at Chartwell, or the Cabinet War Rooms in London—places that evoke his memory and give visitors a sense of the man.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Churchill himself was bigger than Britain. People are still fascinated by this man who was “easily satisfied with the very best.” They marvel at his boundless energy and his tremendous power of concentration. They are also struck by his daily naps, his fondness for Harrow School songs, his witty remarks, his love of animals, and his taste for cigars and Pol Roger champagne. Even after his death, readers can consider his example as a statesman and his reflections in his books.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Born of Welsh parents on January 17, 1863, in Manchester, England, Lloyd George was raised in Caernarvonshire, Wales, and was educated in law as an apprentice in a law firm. From the start of his legal career, Lloyd George was active in local Welsh politics; in 1890 he was elected to Parliament. He was radical in his social views, and supported Welsh nationalism while opposing the war against the Boers in South Africa. In 1905 he was appointed to the cabinet position of president of the Board of Trade with the newly elected Liberal government, and in 1908 he was made chancellor of the Exchequer. The budget he submitted in 1909 contained numerous appropriations for social legislation benefiting the workers, and it met with vigorous opposition from the Conservatives and from the House of Lords, which voted it down. In a speech made in the Limehouse parish of London in 1909, Lloyd George defended his budget and abused his opposition so vociferously that the term</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">limehouse</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> has remained in the English language as a synonym for denunciation of one's political opponents. Shortly thereafter the House of Lords was forbidden by law to consider finance bills, and many of Lloyd George's reforms were adopted, including national sickness and invalidity insurance and unemployment insurance.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">At the beginning of World War I, Lloyd George, as chancellor of the Exchequer, secured Britain's credit and placed the country in a financial position strong enough to endure the war. In 1915 he was appointed to the newly created ministry of munitions, and in 1916 he was made secretary of state for war. He proposed limiting the war cabinet to a smaller, more efficient membership, headed not by the prime minister but by someone concentrating solely on the problems of war. The Liberal prime minister Herbert H. Asquith resigned, and Lloyd George became prime minister of a coalition government. He reduced the policymaking cabinet from 20 to 5 members and worked for a unified Allied command. After the armistice, he participated in the peace conference and helped frame the Treaty of Versailles. In 1920 he introduced the Home Rule Bill for Ireland; largely through his efforts the Irish state was established. The Conservatives withdrew from his coalition government in 1922 in protest against Irish home rule and support by Britain of Greece against Turkey; Lloyd George resigned, and a general election was called in which the Conservatives were elected to power. Lloyd George was reelected to Parliament from his borough and was leader of the opposition until 1931. He was made an earl shortly before his death on March 26, 1945.</FONT></P>

He was financial secretary of the treasury (1917-1921), president of the Board of Trade (1921-1922), and chancellor of the Exchequer (1922-1923). When Andrew Bonar Law resigned in May 1923, Baldwin became prime minister, but he was ousted in January 1924 after having proposed a protective tariff. He returned to office the following November, remaining prime minister for more than five years. When Britain's workers went out on general strike in 1926, he steadfastly refused to meet their demands and in 1927 took steps to curb the power of the trade unions. In the same year he visited Canada, becoming the first incumbent premier to visit an overseas dominion. He resigned in June 1929, following a Labour victory in a general election. In September 1931, Baldwin became lord privy seal and was again prime minister from 1935 to 1937. In 1936&nbsp; his stand against the projected marriage of King Edward VIII to a divorced American woman was instrumental in causing the abdication of the king that year.

As foreign secretary (1878-1880) under Benjamin Disraeli, he prevented Russia from achieving hegemony over Ottoman Turkey and acquired Cyprus for Britain. Salisbury became prime minister in 1885 and—except for a brief period in 1886—held that post until 1892, becoming his own foreign secretary in 1887. In domestic affairs his ministry was responsible for the Local Government Act of 1888 and for the establishment of free public education (1891). In 1889 he secured British possession of what later became the colonies of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe), and the following year he negotiated an agreement with Germany that divided East Africa into British and German spheres of influence. Returning to office as prime minister and foreign secretary in 1895, he won French agreement to Anglo-Egyptian control of the Sudan in 1899 and in the same year involved his country in the Boer War, which led to British control over all of South Africa. Just before leaving office in 1902 he concluded the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which remained in effect until after World War I.

He practiced law after graduating from the University of Oxford in 1874 and was elected to Parliament as a Liberal in 1886. He attained national prominence as junior defense attorney for the Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell, when the latter was under investigation by Parliament in 1888, and in 1892&nbsp; he became home secretary under Prime Minister William Gladstone. Out of office from 1895 to 1905, he then joined a new Liberal government as chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1908&nbsp; he succeeded Henry Campbell-Bannerman as prime minister.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Asquith's tenure in office was marked by a series of domestic and international crises. The first began in 1909, when the House of Lords rejected the government budget, causing Asquith to embark on a campaign to abolish the veto power of Britain's nonelective upper house. After a lengthy struggle he succeeded in his aim with the passage of the Parliament Act in 1911. He then set about plans to accomplish another Liberal objective—the enactment of home rule for Ireland. Controversy over this issue divided the country for the next three years. Confronted by threats of armed rebellion by home-rule opponents in Ulster and open encouragement of these threats by British Conservatives, Asquith temporized throughout 1913 and well into 1914, during which time the pressure continued to build. A violent solution was averted only by the outbreak of World War I.</FONT></P>

As the war dragged on, however, successive military reverses and acute shortages of munitions made his government the object of increasing criticism by Conservatives and Liberals alike. In May 1915, Asquith yielded to demands for a coalition government; in December 1916, the opposition movement forced him to resign in favor of his war secretary, David Lloyd George. Asquith remained in Parliament, but never held office again. He was raised to the peerage in 1925.

<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Gladstone, born in Liverpool, was the son of John Gladstone, a prosperous merchant of Scottish origin. He was raised in a devoutly evangelical home, and religion became a dominant force in his life. Following four years at Eton, he had a distinguished university career at Christ Church, University of Oxford. There, after much soul-searching, he chose politics rather than the church, but he maintained strong religious convictions throughout his life. In 1839 he married Catherine Glynne, and they had eight children.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Gladstone was first elected to Parliament in 1832 with the Tory Party, which became the Conservative Party in that year. Throughout the 1830s the young Gladstone opposed almost all reform; his first speech was a defense of slavery in the West Indies, and he was a staunch defender of the Church of England. In 1843 he became president of the Board of Trade in the Conservative cabinet of</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Sir Robert Peel</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. Gladstone supported Peel's movement toward free trade, but in 1846, when Peel rescinded the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Corn Laws</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, which had taxed imported grain, the Conservative Party was shattered, and Peel's government collapsed. Between 1846 and 1859&nbsp; Gladstone, a Peelite, was politically isolated, although he held some cabinet posts. During this time his views changed from conservative to liberal. He accepted the need for religious freedom, including the admission of Jews into Parliament. He also supported the cause of Italian nationalism and unity, which made him a moral force throughout Europe. In 1859&nbsp; he joined the Liberals and served as chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Palmerston. His consequent acceptance of the democratic principle made him a champion of the lower classes. In 1866 Gladstone proposed amending the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Reform Acts</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> to further enfranchise the working class by using certain monetary amounts paid to landlords as qualifiers, allowing people without land the right to vote. However, the proposal failed, and the government was forced to resign. Gladstone's great rival,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Benjamin Disraeli</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, presented a stronger amendment to the Reform Acts that decreased financial qualifications and extended the vote to householders, including many urban workers. Disraeli's bill passed in 1867.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In his first ministry from 1868&nbsp; to 1874, Gladstone implemented many government reforms. One of his most significant acts was to create in 1870&nbsp; a national elementary education program for all children. His government made major reforms in the justice system, making the central courts more efficient; in the civil service, basing employment on merit; and in the military, abolishing the purchase of army commissions. Another major policy, which haunted Gladstone throughout his career, was his effort to find a solution in Ireland where the Irish demanded their independence from British rule, which Britain was reluctant to grant. The majority of the Irish population were Roman Catholics. However, several hundred years of migration had brought many Anglican and Presbyterian settlers from Great Britain to Ireland. Gladstone disestablished the Anglican church in Ireland, no longer forcing Irish Catholics to pay taxes to support the Anglican church. He also added protection for tenants by requiring that landlords pay compensation for evictions. Gradually, the voters grew tired of reform, and in 1874 the Conservatives were voted into office with Disraeli as prime minister.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">While the Conservatives controlled the government, Gladstone criticized the practices of the Disraeli government in Britain's overseas empire. During the election of 1880, Gladstone won support for his outspoken opposition to the British annexation of the South African Republic, the Afrikaner (or Boer) state in the Transvaal region of what is now northern South Africa. Gladstone was firmly guided by his moral beliefs and could not support what he viewed as an encroachment on free people. He won the election of 1880&nbsp; and resumed his place as prime minister.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">During Gladstone's second ministry, his most important action was the Reform Act of 1884, which extended the vote to many rural voters. He continued to battle with the question of how to establish peace in Ireland, passing the Land Act of 1881, which gave Irish tenant farmers greater control over the land they farmed. However, violence continued in Ireland when the chief secretary and undersecretary were assassinated. By 1885&nbsp; Gladstone believed that Irish home rule was necessary. In foreign affairs, he was criticized for abandoning the Transvaal to the Afrikaners in 1881; for heavily bombing Alexandria during an Egyptian revolt; and in 1885&nbsp; for failing to get relief troops to the Sudan in time to prevent the death of Charles Gordon, a popular British general. Gladstone and his cabinet were slow to react to problems in the empire, arguing against expansion with complicated debates about morality and the treatment of the people in British colonies.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Gladstone's third (1886) and fourth (1892-1894) ministries were dominated by his crusade for home rule in Ireland. His first home rule bill in 1886&nbsp; split the Liberal Party, with many Liberals refusing to support any reduction in British power over Ireland. In 1893 a second home rule bill passed the House of Commons, but it was rejected by the House of Lords. Gladstone, who as early as 1868 had stated that his “mission” was to “pacify Ireland,” wanted to continue to fight for home rule, but his cabinet refused. He therefore resigned as prime minister in 1894 and retired. He died of cancer at the age of 88 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Gladstone was able to mobilize the idealism of the British public, and he believed that government reform created improvement for all British citizens. He responded to the needs of exploited workers with his reforms by increasing enfranchisement and providing public education, although some historians question whether he really understood the needs of the working classes. Gladstone created a strong Liberal Party, and his governments provided political stability in England for almost three decades. Throughout his career, he was guided by his morality and firm religious beliefs. He distrusted imperialism and decried mistreatment of people throughout the world. He became a leading symbol of the reforming trends of the Victorian Age.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Severe mental illness almost always alters a person’s life dramatically. People with severe mental illnesses experience disturbing symptoms that can make it difficult to hold a job, go to school, relate to others, or cope with ordinary life demands.

People who develop</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">schizophrenia</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> may hear voices inside their head that say nasty things about them or command them to act in strange or unpredictable ways. Or they may be paralyzed by</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">paranoia</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">—the deep conviction that everyone, including their closest family members, wants to injure or destroy them.

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Other mental illnesses, while not always debilitating, create certain problems in living. People with</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">personality disorders</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> may experience loneliness and isolation because their personality style interferes with social relations. People with an eating disorder may become so preoccupied with their weight and appearance that they force themselves to vomit or refuse to eat. Individuals who develop</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">post-traumatic stress disorder</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> may become angry easily, experience disturbing memories, and have trouble concentrating.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Experiences of mental illness often differ depending on one’s culture or social group, sometimes greatly so. For example, in most of the non-Western world, people with depression complain principally of physical ailments, such as lack of energy, poor sleep, loss of appetite, and various kinds of physical pain. Indeed, even in North America these complaints are commonplace. But in the United States and other Western societies, depressed people and mental health professionals who treat them tend to emphasize psychological problems, such as feelings of sadness, worthlessness, and despair. The experience of schizophrenia also differs by culture. In India, one-third of new cases of schizophrenia involve</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">catatonia,</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> a behavioral condition in which a person maintains a bizarre statuelike pose for hours or days. This condition is rare in Europe and North America.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">With appropriate treatment, most people can recover from mental illness and return to normal life.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In most societies mental illness carries a substantial stigma, or mark of shame. The mentally ill are often blamed for bringing on their own illnesses, and others may see them as victims of bad fate, religious and moral transgression, or witchcraft. Such stigma may keep families from acknowledging that a family member is ill. Some families may hide or overprotect a member with mental illness—keeping the person from receiving potentially effective care—or they may reject the person from the family. When magnified from individuals to a whole society, such attitudes lead to underfunding of mental health services and terribly inadequate care. In much of the world, even today, the mentally ill are chained, caged, or hospitalized in filthy, brutal institutions. Yet attitudes toward mental illness have improved in many areas, especially owing to health education and advocacy for the mentally ill.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Mental illness creates enormous social and economic costs. Depression, for example, affects some 500 million people in the world and results in more time lost to disability than such chronic diseases as</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">diabetes mellitus</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> and</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">arthritis</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. Estimating the economic cost of mental illness is complex because there are direct costs (actual medical expenditures), indirect costs (the cost to individuals and society due to reduced or lost productivity, for example), and support costs (time lost to care of family members with mental illnesses). One study estimated that in 1985 the economic costs of mental illness in the United States totaled $103.7 billion. Of this, treatment and support costs totaled $42.5 billion, which represented 11.5 percent of the total cost of care for all illnesses.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Another method of estimating the cost of mental illness to society measures the impact of premature deaths and disablements. Research by the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">World Health Organization</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> and the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">World Bank</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> estimated that in 1990, among the world’s population aged 15 to 44 years, depression accounted for more than 10 percent of the total burden attributable to all diseases. Two other illnesses,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">bipolar disorder</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> and</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">schizophrenia</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, accounted for another 6 percent of the burden.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">No universally accepted definition of mental illness exists. In general, the definition of mental illness depends on a society’s norms, or rules of behavior. Behaviors that violate these norms are considered signs of deviance or, in some cases, of mental illness.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Because norms vary between cultures, behaviors considered signs of mental illness in one culture may be considered normal in other cultures. For example, in the United States, a person who experiences trance and possession states (altered</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">states of consciousness</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">) is usually diagnosed as suffering from a mental illness. Yet, in many non-Western countries, people consider such states an essential part of human experience. In</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Native American</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> culture, it is common for people to hear the voices of recently deceased loved ones. In contrast, most mental health professionals in Western cultures would consider such behavior a possible symptom of schizophrenia or</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">psychosis</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The variation in behavioral norms does not mean, however, that definitions of mental illness are necessarily incompatible across cultures. Many behaviors are recognized throughout the world as being indicative of mental illness. These include extreme social withdrawal, violence to oneself,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">hallucinations</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (false sensory perceptions), and</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">delusions</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (fixed, false ideas).</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Another way of defining mental illness is based on whether a person’s behaviors are maladaptive—that is, whether they cause a person to experience problems in coping with common life demands. For example, people with social phobia may avoid interacting with other people and experience problems at work as a result. Critics note that under this definition, political dissidents could be considered mentally ill for refusing to accept the dictates of their government.</FONT></P>

An additional 2.8 percent of adults, or about 5.2 million people, experience a mental illness that seriously interferes with one or more aspects of their daily life, such as their ability to work or relate to other people.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Young people can suffer from mental illnesses and psychological problems just as adults can. Prevalence estimates in industrialized countries indicate that from 14 to 20 percent of individuals under age 18 suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder. In the United States, an estimated 9 to 13 percent of children between the ages of 9 and 17 suffer from a serious emotional disturbance—that is, a disorder that severely disrupts a child's daily functioning in the family, school, or community.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Anxiety disorders are the most common childhood mental disorders, affecting an estimated 8 to 10 percent of children and adolescents in the United States.

About 4 percent of children and young adolescents experience severe</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">separation anxiety</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> and worry excessively about becoming separated from their parents. Depression is another common childhood mental disorder, affecting up to 2.5 percent of children (under age 13) and up to 8.3 percent of adolescents in the United States.

The prevalence of depression and other mental illnesses is much higher among elderly residents of nursing homes. Although most older people with depression respond to treatment, many cases of depression among the elderly go undetected or untreated. Research indicates that depression is a major risk factor for suicide among the elderly in the United States. People over age 65 in the United States have the highest suicide rate of any age group.</FONT> </P>

Rates of almost all mental illnesses decline as levels of income and education increase. A national survey published in 1994 indicated that people who earned $19,000 or less annually in the United States were twice as likely to have experienced an anxiety disorder as people who earned $70,000 or more. The hardships associated with poverty seem to contribute to the development of some mental illnesses, particularly anxiety disorders and depression. In addition, debilitating mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, may cause individuals to drift to lower socioeconomic classes.</FONT></P>

First, increases in life expectancy have brought increased numbers of certain chronic mental illnesses. For example, because more people are living into old age, more people are suffering from dementia. Second, a number of studies provide evidence that rates of depression are rising throughout the world. The reasons may be related to such factors as economic change, political and social violence, and cultural disruptions. While some have questioned these findings, dramatic increases in the numbers of refugees and people dislocated from their homes by economic forces or civil strife are associated with great increases in a variety of mental illnesses for those populations. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the number of refugees worldwide increased from 2.5 million in 1971 to 13.2 million in 1996, peaking at 17 million in 1991.</FONT></P>

Others seem to occur only in particular cultures. For example, eating disorders, such as</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">anorexia nervosa</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (compulsive dieting associated with unrealistic fears of fatness), occur mostly among girls and women in Europe, North America, and Westernized areas of Asia, whose cultures view thinness as an essential component of female beauty.

The fourth edition, known as</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">DSM-IV,</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> describes more than 300 mental disorders, behavioral disorders, addictive disorders, and other psychological problems and groups them into broad categories. This article describes some of the major categories, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, personality disorders, cognitive disorders, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, substance-related disorders, eating disorders, and impulse-control disorders. Mental health professionals in many other parts of the world use a different classification system, the</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">International Classification of Diseases (ICD)</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, published by the World Health Organization.</FONT></P>

In theory, each disorder should possess diagnostic criteria that are independent of one another, just as tuberculosis and lung cancer are discrete diseases. Yet symptoms of many mental disorders overlap, and many people—such as those who experience both depression and severe anxiety—show symptoms of more than one disorder at the same time. For these reasons, some mental health professionals advocate a dimensional system of classification. In contrast to the categorical approach, which sees mental disorders as qualitatively distinct from normal behavior, a dimensional system views behavior as falling along a continuum of normality, with some behaviors considered more abnormal than others. In a dimensional system, diagnoses do not describe discrete diseases but rather portray the relative importance of an array of symptoms.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Definitions and classifications of mental illnesses change as research improves understanding of them. For example,</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">DSM-IV</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> allows a diagnosis of schizophrenia only when characteristic symptoms have lasted at least one month, whereas the previous edition of</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">DSM</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> required a duration of only one week.</FONT></P>

The modern era of psychiatry, which began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, has witnessed a sharp debate between biological and psychological perspectives of mental illness. The biological perspective views mental illness in terms of bodily processes, whereas psychological perspectives emphasize the roles of a person’s upbringing and environment.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">These two perspectives are exemplified in the work of German psychiatrist</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Emil Kraepelin</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> and Austrian psychoanalyst</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Sigmund Freud</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. Kraepelin, influenced by the work in the mid-1800s of German psychiatrist Wilhelm Griesinger, believed that psychiatric disorders were disease entities that could be classified like physical illnesses. That is, Kraepelin believed that the fundamental causes of mental illness lay in the physiology and biochemistry of the human</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">brain</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. His classification system of mental disorders, first published in 1883, formed the basis for later diagnostic systems. Freud, on the other hand, argued that the source of mental illness lay in unconscious conflicts originating in early childhood experiences. Freud found evidence for this idea through the analysis of</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">dreams</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">free association</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, and slips of speech.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">This debate has continued into the late 20th century. Beginning in the 1960s, the biological perspective became dominant, supported by numerous breakthroughs in</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">psychopharmacology</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">genetics</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">neurophysiology</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, and brain research. For example, scientists discovered many medications that helped to relieve symptoms of certain mental illnesses and demonstrated that people can inherit a vulnerability to some mental illnesses. Psychological perspectives also remain influential, including the psychodynamic perspective, the humanistic and existential perspectives, the behavioral perspective, the cognitive perspective, and the sociocultural perspective.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Many mental health professionals today favor a combination of perspectives, acknowledging that both biology and a person’s environment play important roles in mental illness. This approach recognizes that people are not only products of the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">genes</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> inherited from their parents, but products of the families and social worlds into which they are born. In this view, environments shape how biological factors will be manifested. For example, an infant may inherit genes that could enable her to become a tall adult, but if she is malnourished as a child, she will never achieve that potential. Likewise, an individual who does not possess a biological vulnerability for depression may nevertheless become severely depressed following the death of a loved one or after experiencing an act of torture.</FONT></P>

These include</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">dopamine</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">serotonin</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, norepinephrine (</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">see</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">epinephrine</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">), gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), and</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">acetylcholine</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. Excesses and deficiencies in levels of these neurotransmitters have been associated with depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, but scientists have yet to determine the exact mechanisms involved.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Advances in brain imaging techniques, such as</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">magnetic resonance imaging</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (MRI) and</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">positron emission tomography</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> (PET), have enabled scientists to study the role of brain structure in mental illness. Some studies have revealed structural brain abnormalities in certain mental illnesses. For example, some people with schizophrenia have enlarged brain ventricles (cavities in the brain that contain cerebrospinal fluid). However, this may be a result of schizophrenia rather than a cause, and not all people with schizophrenia show this abnormality.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">A variety of medical conditions can cause mental illness.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The psychodynamic perspective views mental illness as caused by unconscious and unresolved conflicts in the mind. As stated by Freud, these conflicts arise in early childhood and may cause mental illness by impeding the balanced development of the three systems that constitute the human psyche: the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">id</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, which comprises innate sexual and aggressive drives; the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">ego</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, the conscious portion of the mind that mediates between the unconscious and reality; and the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">superego</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, which controls the primitive impulses of the id and represents moral ideals. In this view, generalized anxiety disorder stems from a signal of unconscious danger whose source can only be identified through a thorough analysis of the person’s personality and life experiences. Modern psychodynamic theorists tend to emphasize sexuality less than Freud did and focus more on problems in the individual’s relationships with others.</FONT></P>

The humanistic school of psychology, as represented in the work of American psychologist</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Carl Rogers</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, views mental health and personal growth as the natural conditions of human life. In Rogers’s view, every person possesses a drive toward</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">self-actualization,</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> the fulfillment of one’s greatest potential. Mental illness develops when circumstances in a person’s environment block this drive. The existential perspective sees emotional disturbances as the result of a person’s failure to act authentically—that is, to behave in accordance with one’s own goals and values, rather than the goals and values of others.</FONT></P>

Skinner</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, maintained that psychology should confine itself to the study of observable behavior, rather than explore a person’s unconscious feelings. The behavioral perspective explains mental illness, as well as all of human behavior, as a learned response to stimuli. In this view, rewards and punishments in a person’s environment shape that person’s behavior. For example, a person involved in a serious car accident may develop a phobia of cars or generalize the fear to all forms of transportation.</FONT></P>

American psychiatrist Aaron Beck proposed that some mental illnesses—such as depression, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders—result from a way of thinking learned in childhood that is not consistent with reality. For example, people with depression tend to see themselves in a negative light, exaggerate the importance of minor flaws or failures, and misinterpret the behavior of others in negative ways. It remains unclear, however, whether these kinds of cognitive problems actually cause mental illness or merely represent symptoms of the illnesses themselves.</FONT></P>

Evidence for this view comes from research that has demonstrated an increased risk of mental illness among people living in</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">poverty</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. In addition, the incidence of mental illness rises in times of high</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">unemployment</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">. The shift in the world population from rural areas to cities—with their crowding, noise, pollution, decay, and social isolation—has also been implicated in causing relatively high rates of mental illness. Furthermore, rapid social change, which has particularly affected indigenous peoples throughout the world, brings about high rates of suicide and alcoholism.</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Refugees</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> and victims of social disasters—</FONT><FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">warfare</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, displacement,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">genocide</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, violence—have a higher risk of mental illness, especially depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Social scientists emphasize that the link between social ills and mental illness is correlational rather than causal. For example, although societies undergoing rapid social change often have high rates of suicide the specific causes have not been identified.

Thus, the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">diagnosis</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> of mental illness is always a judgment or an interpretation by an observer based on the speech, ideas, behaviors, and experiences of the patient.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">For the most part, mental health professionals determine the presence of mental illness in an individual by conducting an interview intended to reveal symptoms of abnormal behavior. That is, the professional asks the patient questions about his or her mental state: “Do you hear voices of people who are not with you?” “Have you felt depressed or lost interest in most activities?” “Have you experienced a marked increase or decrease in your appetite?” “Have you been sleeping less than normal?” “Are you easily distracted?” The answers to these questions will suggest other questions. Eventually, the clinician will feel that he or she has enough information to determine whether the patient is suffering from a mental illness and, if so, to make a diagnosis.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The process of diagnosis is not as simple as it might seem. Patients often have difficulty remembering symptoms or feel reluctant to talk about their fantasies, sex life, or use of drugs and alcohol. Many patients suffer from more than one disorder at a time—for example, depression and anxiety, or schizophrenia and depression—and determining which symptoms constitute the primary problem is complex. In addition, symptoms may not be specific to mental illnesses. For example, brain tumors, malaria, and infections of the central nervous system can produce symptoms that mimic those of psychotic disorders.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Another problem in diagnosis is that mental health professionals may interpret symptoms differently based on their personal or cultural biases. One study examined this effect by showing 300 American and British psychiatrists videotaped interviews of eight patients with mental illnesses. Although the psychiatrists’ diagnoses substantially agreed for patients with “textbook” cases of schizophrenia, their diagnoses varied widely for patients who had symptoms of both schizophrenia and other disorders, depending on whether the psychiatrist was American or British. The risk of misdiagnosis is even greater when the mental health professional and the patient come from different cultural groups.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Mental health professionals use a number of methods to treat people with mental illnesses. The two most common treatments by far are drug therapy and psychotherapy. In drug therapy, a person takes regular doses of a prescription medication intended to reduce symptoms of mental illness.</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Psychotherapy</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> is the treatment of mental illness through verbal and nonverbal communication between the patient and a trained professional. A person can receive psychotherapy individually or in a group setting.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The type of treatment administered depends on the type and severity of the disorder. For example, doctors usually treat schizophrenia primarily with drugs, but specialized forms of psychotherapy may more effectively relieve phobias. For some mental illnesses, such as depression, the most effective treatment seems to be a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy. Although some people with severe mental illnesses may never fully recover, most people with mental illnesses improve with treatment and can resume normal lives. Despite the availability of effective treatments, only about 40 percent of people with mental illnesses ever seek professional help.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Drugs introduced in the mid-1950s enabled many people who otherwise would have spent years in mental institutions to return to the community and live productive lives. Since then, advances in psychopharmacology have led to the development of drugs of even greater effectiveness. These drugs often relieve symptoms of schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and other disorders. However, they may produce undesirable and sometimes serious side effects. In addition, relapse may occur when they are discontinued, so long-term use may be required. Drugs that control symptoms of mental illness are called</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">psychotherapeutic</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> drugs. The major categories of psychotherapeutic drugs include antipsychotic drugs, antianxiety drugs,</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">antidepressant</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> drugs, and antimanic drugs.</FONT></P>

They may help people with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and other anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs that includes diazepam (Valium), are the most widely prescribed antianxiety drugs. Benzodiazepines can be addictive and may cause drowsiness and impaired coordination during the day.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Antidepressant drugs</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> help relieve symptoms of depression. Some antidepressant drugs can relieve symptoms of other disorders as well, such as panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Antidepressant drugs comprise three major classes: tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">MAO inhibitors</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Side effects of tricyclics may include dizziness upon standing, blurred vision, dry mouth, difficulty urinating, constipation, and drowsiness. People who take MAO inhibitors may experience some of the same side effects, and must follow a special diet that excludes certain foods. SSRIs generally produce fewer side effects, although these may include anxiety, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Psychotherapy can be an effective treatment for many mental illnesses. Unlike drug therapy, psychotherapy produces no physical side effects, although it can cause psychological damage when improperly administered. On the other hand, psychotherapy may take longer than drugs to produce benefits. In addition, sessions may be expensive and time-consuming. In response to this complaint and demands from insurance companies to reduce the costs of mental health treatment, many therapists have started providing therapy of shorter duration.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Psychotherapy encompasses a wide range of techniques and practices. Some forms of psychotherapy, such as psychodynamic therapy and humanistic therapy, focus on helping people understand the internal motivations for their problematic behavior. Other forms of therapy, such as behavioral therapy and cognitive therapy, focus on the behavior itself and teach people skills to correct it. The majority of therapists today incorporate treatment techniques from a number of theoretical perspectives.

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The literature of ancient Greece and Rome contains evidence of the belief that spirits or demons cause mental illness. In the 5th century</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">BC</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> the Greek historian Herodotus wrote an account of a king who was driven mad by evil spirits. The legend of Hercules describes how, driven insane by a curse, he killed his own children. The Roman poets Virgil and Ovid repeated these themes in their works. The early Babylonian, Chinese, and Egyptian civilizations also viewed mental illness as possession, and used exorcism—which sometimes involved beatings, restraint, and starvation—to drive the evil spirits from their victim.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Not all ancient scholars agreed with this theory of mental illness. The Greek physician Hippocrates believed that all illnesses, including mental illnesses, had natural origins. For example, he rejected the prevailing notion that epilepsy had its origins in the divine or sacred, viewing it as a disease of the brain. Hippocrates classified mental illnesses into categories that included mania, melancholia (depression), and phrenitis (brain fever), and he advocated humane treatment that included rest, bathing, exercise, and dieting. The Greek philosopher Plato, although adhering to a somewhat supernatural view of mental illness, believed that childhood experiences shaped adult behaviors, anticipating modern psychodynamic theories by more than 2000 years.</FONT></P>

Much of society believed that mentally ill people were possessed by the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">devil</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> or demons, or accused them of being witches and infecting others with madness (</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">see</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Witchcraft</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">). Thus, instead of receiving care from physicians, the mentally ill became objects of religious inquisition and barbaric treatment. On the other hand, some historians of medicine cite evidence that even in the Middle Ages, many people believed mental illness to have its basis in physical and psychological disturbances, such as imbalances in the four bodily humors (blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm), poor diet, and grief.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The Islamic world of North Africa, Spain, and the Middle East generally held far more humane attitudes toward people with mental illnesses. Following the belief that God loved insane people, communities began establishing asylums beginning in the 8th century</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">AD</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, first in Baghd</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">â</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">d and later in Cairo, Damascus, and Fez.

The infamous</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Malleus Maleficarum</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">,which served as a handbook for inquisitors, claimed that witches could be identified by delusions, hallucinations, or other peculiar behavior. To make matters worse, many of the most eminent physicians of the time fervently advocated these beliefs.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">On the other hand, some scholars vigorously protested these supernatural views and called renewed attention to more rational explanations of behavior. In the early 16th century, for example, the Swiss physician</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Paracelsus</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> returned to the views of Hippocrates, asserting that mental illnesses were due to natural causes. Later in the century, German physician Johann Weyer argued that witches were actually mentally disturbed people in need of humane medical treatment.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">During the Age of Enlightenment, in the 18th and early 19th centuries, people with mental illnesses continued to suffer from poor treatment. For the most part, they were left to wander the countryside or committed to institutions. In either case, conditions were generally wretched. One mental hospital, the Hospital of Saint Mary of Bethlehem in London, England, became notorious for its noisy, chaotic conditions and cruel treatment of patients (</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">see</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"></FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Bedlam</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">).</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Yet as the public’s awareness of such conditions grew, improvements in care and treatment began to appear. In 1789 Vincenzo Chiarugi, superintendent of a mental hospital in Florence, Italy, introduced hospital regulations that provided patients with high standards of hygiene, recreation and work opportunities, and minimal restraint. At nearly the same time, Jean-Baptiste Pussin, superintendent of a ward for “incurable” mental patients at La Bicêtre hospital in Paris, France, forbade staff to beat patients and released patients from shackles. Philippe Pinel continued these reforms upon becoming chief physician of La Bicêtre’s ward for the mentally ill in 1793. Pinel began to keep case histories of patients and developed the concept of “moral treatment,” which involved treating patients with kindness and sensitivity, and without cruelty or violence. In 1796 a Quaker named William Tuke established the York Retreat in rural England, which became a model of compassionate care. The retreat enabled people with mental illnesses to rest peacefully, talk about their problems, and work. Eventually these humane techniques became widespread in Europe.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">People living in the colonies of North America in the 17th and 18th centuries generally explained bizarre or deviant behavior as God’s will or the work of the devil. Some people with mental illnesses received care from their families, but most were jailed or confined in almshouses with the poor and infirm. By the mid-18th century, however, American physicians came to view mental illnesses as diseases of the brain, and advocated specialized facilities to treat the mentally ill. The Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, which opened in 1752, became the first hospital in the American colonies to admit people with mental illnesses, housing them in a separate ward. However, in the hospital’s early years, mentally ill patients were chained to the walls of dark, cold cells.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In the 1780s American physician</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Benjamin Rush</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> instituted changes at the Pennsylvania Hospital that greatly improved conditions for mentally ill patients. Although he endorsed the continued use of restraints, punishment, and bleeding, he also arranged for heat and better ventilation in the wards, separation of violent patients from other patients, and programs that offered work, exercise, and recreation to patients. Between 1817 and 1828, following the examples of Tuke and Pinel, a number of institutions opened that devoted themselves exclusively to the care of mentally ill people. The first private mental hospital in the United States was the Asylum for the Relief of Persons Deprived of the Use of Their Reason (now Friends Hospital), opened by Quakers in 1817 in what is now Philadelphia. Other privately established institutions soon followed, and state-sponsored hospitals—in Kentucky, New York, Virginia, and South Carolina—-opened beginning in 1824.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Nevertheless, circumstances for most mentally ill people in the United States, especially those who were poor, remained dreadful. In 1841</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Dorothea Dix</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">, a Boston schoolteacher, began a campaign to make the public aware of the plight of mentally ill people. By 1880, as a direct result of her efforts, 32 psychiatric hospitals for the poor had opened. Increasingly, society viewed psychiatric institutions as the most appropriate form of care for people with mental illnesses. However, by the late 19th century, conditions in these institutions had deteriorated. Overcrowded and understaffed, psychiatric hospitals had shifted their treatment approach from moral therapy to warehousing and punishment. In 1908</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#324CCF" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">Clifford Whittingham Beers</FONT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> aroused new concern for mentally ill individuals with the publication of</FONT><I> <FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">A Mind That Found Itself,</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif"> an account of his experiences as a mental patient.

Many mental health professionals—seeing that large state institutions caused as much, if not more, harm to patients than mental illnesses themselves—came to believe that only patients with severe symptoms should be hospitalized. In addition, the development in the 1950s of antipsychotic drugs, which helped to control bizarre and violent behavior, allowed more patients to be treated in the community. In combination, these factors led to the deinstitutionalization movement: the release, over the next four decades, of hundreds of thousands of patients from state mental hospitals. In 1950, 513,000 patients resided in these institutions. By 1965 there were 475,000, and by 1990 state mental hospitals housed only 92,000 patients on any given night. Many patients who were released returned to their families, although many were transferred to questionable conditions in nursing homes or board-and-care homes. Many patients had no place to go and began to live on the streets.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The National Mental Health Act of 1946 created the National Institute of Mental Health as a center for research and funding of research on mental illness. In 1955 Congress created a commission to investigate the state of mental health care, treatment, and prevention. In 1963, as a result of the commission’s findings, Congress passed the Community Mental Health Centers Act, which authorized the construction of community mental health centers throughout the country. Implementation of these centers was not as extensive as originally planned, and many people with severe mental illnesses failed to receive care of any kind.</FONT></P>

The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), one of the most influential of these groups, was founded in 1972. NAMI’s goal is to improve the lives of people with severe mental illnesses and their families by eliminating discrimination in housing and employment and by improving access to essential treatments and programs.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">During the 1980s, all levels of government in the United States cut back on funding for social services. For example, the Social Security Administration discontinued benefits for approximately 300,000 people between 1981 and 1983. Of these, an estimated 100,000 were people with mental illnesses. Although the government eventually restored Social Security benefits to many of these people, the interruption of services caused widespread hardship.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">The emergence of managed care in the 1990s as a way to contain health care costs had a tremendous impact on mental health care in the United States. Health insurance companies and health maintenance organizations increasingly scrutinized the effectiveness of various psychotherapies and drug treatments and put stricter limits on mental health care. In response to these restrictions, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. This law required private medical plans that offer mental health coverage to set equal yearly and lifetime payment limits for coverage of both mental and physical illnesses.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#323232" FACE="MS Reference Sans Serif">In 1997 the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued new guidelines intended to prevent discrimination against people with mental illnesses in the workplace. The rules, based on the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, prohibit employers from asking job applicants if they have a history of mental illness and require employers to provide reasonable accommodations to workers with mental illnesses.</FONT></P>
