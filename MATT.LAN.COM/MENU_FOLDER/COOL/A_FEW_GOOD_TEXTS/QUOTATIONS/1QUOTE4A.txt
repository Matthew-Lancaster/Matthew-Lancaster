--------- Ability ---------
---------------------------

Knowing what you can not do is more important than knowing what you can do.  In fact, that's good taste.

1911-89
U.S. actor, producer

Quoted in: Eleanor Harris, The Real Story of Lucille Ball, ch. 1 (1954).

1817-62
U.S. philosopher, author, naturalist

----------------------------
--------- Abortion ---------
----------------------------

The one regret I have about my own abortions is that they cost money that might otherwise have been spent on something more pleasurable, like taking the kids to movies and theme parks.


Barbara Ehrenreich 
b. 1941
U.S. author, columnist

The Worst Years of Our Lives,  "Their Dilemma and Mine"  (1991; first published 1989).

Ruth Bader Ginsberg 
b. 1933
U.S. educator, Supreme Court justice

Quoted in: Ms.  (New York, April 1974).


--------
Abortion
--------

The compelled mother loves her child as the caged bird sings.  The song does not justify the cage nor the love the enforcement.

John Paul II [Karol Wojtyla] 
b. 1920
Polish ecclesiastic, pope

Quoted in: Observer  (London, 9 June 1991).


--------
Abortion
--------

The preservation of life seems to be rather a slogan than a genuine goal of the anti-abortion forces; what they want is control.  Control over behavior: power over women.  Women in the anti-choice movement want to share in male power over women, and do so by denying their own womanhood, their own rights and responsibilities.


Ursula K. Le Guin 
b. 1929
U.S. author

 "The Princess," address, Jan. 1982, to National Abortion Rights Action League, Portland, Maine (published in Dancing at the Edge of the World, 1989).


--------
Abortion
--------

In the middle-class United States, a veneer of "alternative lifestyles" disguises the reality that, here as everywhere, women's apparent "choices" whether or not to have children are still dependent on the far from neutral will of male legislators, jurists, a male medical and pharmaceutical profession, well-financed lobbies, including the prelates of the Catholic Church, and the political reality that women do not as yet have self-determination over our bodies and still live mostly in ignorance of our authentic physicality, our possible choices, our eroticism itself.


Adrienne Rich 
b. 1929
U.S. poet

 "Motherhood: The Contemporary Emergency and the Quantum Leap," paper, 2 June 1978, read at Future of Mothering Conference, Columbus, Ohio (published in On Lies, Secrets, and Silence, 1980).


--------
Abortion
--------

Dread not infanticide; the crime is imaginary: we are always mistress of what we carry in our womb, and we do no more harm in destroying this kind of matter than in evacuating another, by medicines, when we feel the need.


Marquis De Sade 
1740-1814
French author

Mme de Saint-Ange, in Philosophy in the Bedroom,  "Dialogue the Third"  (1795).


--------
Abortion
--------

The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me? There is nothing between.

b. 1910
Albanian-born Roman Catholic missionary in India

Nobel Peace Prize Lecture, 1979.

Absence
-------

The heart may think it knows better: the senses know that absence blots people out.  We really have no absent friends.  The friend becomes a traitor by breaking, however unwillingly or sadly, out of our own zone: a hard judgment is passed on him, for all the pleas of the heart.


Elizabeth Bowen 
1899-1973
Anglo-Irish novelist

The Death of the Heart, pt. 2, ch. 2  (1938).

And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.


Lord Byron 
1788-1824
English poet

Don Juan, cto. 3, st. 22.


-------
Absence
-------

It is singular how soon we lose the impression of what ceases to be constantly before us; a year impairs; a lustre obliterates.  There is little distinct left without an effort of memory. Then, indeed, the lights are rekindled for a moment. . . . Let any man try at the end of ten years to bring before him the features, or the mind, or the sayings, or the habits, of his best friend.


Lord Byron 
1788-1824
English poet

Journal at Ravenna, 1821-22. Quoted in Doris Langley Moore, The Late Lord Byron, ch. 8 (1961; rev. ed., 1976).

Colley Cibber 
1671-1757
English actor-manager, playwright

Tamira, in Xerxes, act 4, sc. 3.


-------
Absence
-------

Separated lovers cheat absence by a thousand fancies which have their own reality.  They are prevented from seeing one another and they cannot write; nevertheless they find countless mysterious ways of corresponding, by sending each other the song of birds, the scent of flowers, the laughter of children, the light of the sun, the sighing of the wind, and the gleam of the stars --all the beauties of creation.


Victor Hugo 
1802-85
French poet, dramatist, novelist

Marius, in Les Misérables, pt. 4, bk. 5, ch. 4 (1862).

1613-80
French writer, moralist

Sentences et Maximes Morales, no. 276  (1678). Comte de Bussy-Rabutin used the same comparison for love:  "Absence is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, it enkindles the great."  (in Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules).


-------
Absence
-------

 "Presents," I often say,  "endear absents."


Charles Lamb

-------

Let me tell you I am better acquainted with you for a long absence, as men are with themselves for a long affliction: absence does but hold off a friend, to make one see him the truer.


Alexander Pope 
1688-1744
English satirical poet

Letter, 14 Dec. 1725, to poet and author Jonathan Swift.


-------
Absence

How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,
What old December's bareness everywhere!


William Shakespeare

English dramatist, poet

-------

When delicate and feeling souls are separated, there is not a feature in the sky, not a movement of the elements, not an aspiration of the breeze, but hints some cause for a lover's apprehension.

It is not funny that anything else should fall down; only that a man should fall down. . . . Why do we laugh?  Because it is a gravely religious matter: it is the Fall of Man.  Only man can be absurd: for only man can be dignified.


G. K. Chesterton 
1874-1936
British author

All Things Considered,  "Spiritualism"  (1908).

---------
Absurdity
---------

We live in a time which has created the art of the absurd.  It is our art.  It contains happenings, Pop art, camp, a theater of the absurd. . . . Do we have the art because the absurd is the patina of waste. . .?  Or are we face to face with a desperate or most rational effort from the deepest resources of the unconscious of us all to rescue civilization from the pit and plague of its bedding?

----------------------------
--------- Academia ---------
----------------------------

I realized early on that the academy and the literary world alike --and I don't think there really is a distinction between the two --are always dominated by fools, knaves, charlatans and bureaucrats.  And that being the case, any human being, male or female, of whatever status, who has a voice of her or his own, is not going to be liked.


Harold Bloom 
b. 1930
U.S. literary critic, theorist

Interview in Criticism in Society  (ed. by Imre Salusinski, 1987).


--------
Academia
--------

There is but one step from the Academy to the Fad.


Samuel Butler 
1835-1902

--------
Academia
--------

--------

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 
1807-82

Camille Paglia 
b. 1947
U.S. author, critic, educator

Sex, Art, and American Culture, Introduction (1992).


--------
Academia
--------

--------
Academia
--------

Art is not to be taught in Academies.  It is what one looks at, not what one listens to, that makes the artist.  The real schools should be the streets.


Oscar Wilde 
1854-1900
Anglo-Irish playwright, author

 "The Relation of Dress to Art: A Note in Black and White on Mr. Whistler's Lecture," in Pall Mall Gazette  (London, 28 Feb. 1885).


--------
Academia
--------

In universities and intellectual circles, academics can guarantee themselves popularity --or, which is just as satisfying, unpopularity --by being opinionated rather than by being learned.


A. N. Wilson 
b. 1950
British author

Guardian book review (London, 30 Sept. 1989).

Is boredom anything less than the sense of one's faculties slowly dying?


John Berger 
b. 1926
British author, critic

A Fortunate Man  (1967; repr. 1976, p. 133).


-------
Boredom
-------

The world is eaten up by boredom. . . . You can't see it all at once.  It is like dust.  You go about and never notice, you breathe it in, you eat and drink it.  It is sifted so fine, it doesn't even grit on your teeth.  But stand still for an instant and there it is, coating your face and hands.  To shake off this drizzle of ashes you must be for ever on the go. And so people are always "on the go."


Georges Bernanos 
1888-1948
French novelist, political writer

The Diary of a Country Priest, ch. 1 (1936; tr. 1937).


-------
Boredom
-------

Life, friends, is boring.  We must not say so.
After all, the sky flashes, the great sea yearns,
we ourselves flash and yearn,
and moreover my mother told me as a boy
 (repeatingly)  "Ever to confess you're bored
means you have no
Inner Resources."  I conclude now I have no
inner resources, because I am heavy bored.


John Berryman 
1914-72
U.S. poet

The Dreamsongs, no. 14 (1969).


-------
Boredom
-------

French Situationist philosopher

The Incomplete Works of the Situationist International,  "The Bad Old Days Will End"  (Nov. 1963; ed. by Christopher Gray, 1974).


-------
Boredom
-------

My mind rebels at stagnation.  Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere.  I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence.  I crave for mental exaltation.


Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
1859-1930
English author

Sherlock Holmes, in The Sign of Four, ch. 1 (1890).


-------
Boredom
-------

Boredom is not an end-product, is comparatively rather an early stage in life and art.  You've got to go by or past or through boredom, as through a filter, before the clear product emerges.


F. Scott Fitzgerald 
1896-1940
U.S. author

The Crack-Up,  "Notebook I"  (ed. by Edmund Wilson, 1945).


-------
Boredom
-------

There are moments when, faced with our lack of success, I wonder whether we are failures, proud but impotent.  One thing reassures me as to our value: the boredom that afflicts us.  It is the hall-mark of quality in modern men.


Edmond And Jules De Goncourt 
1822-96
French writers

The Goncourt Journals  (1888-96; repr. in Pages from the Goncourt Journal, ed. by Robert Baldick, 1962), entry for 30 July 1861.


-------
Boredom
-------

To do the same thing over and over again is not only boredom: it is to be controlled by rather than to control what you do.


Heraclitus 
c. 535 B.C. -c. 475 B.C.

Greek philosopher

Herakleitos and Diogenes, pt. 1, fragment 89 (tr. by Guy Davenport, 1976).


-------
Boredom
-------

Since boredom advances and boredom is the root of all evil, no wonder, then, that the world goes backwards, that evil spreads.  This can be traced back to the very beginning of the world.  The gods were bored; therefore they created human beings.


Soren Kierkegaard 
1813-55
Danish philosopher

Either/Or, vol. 1,  "Rotation of Crops"  (1843; tr. 1987).


-------
Boredom
-------

The life of a creator is not the only life nor perhaps the most interesting which a man leads.  There is a time for play and a time for work, a time for creation and a time for lying fallow.  And there is a time, glorious too in its own way, when one scarcely exists, when one is a complete void.  I mean --when boredom seems the very stuff of life.


Henry Miller 
1891-1980
U.S. author

The Books in My Life, ch. 12 (1951).


-------

German philosopher

The Anti-Christ, aph. 48 (1895). Nietzsche refers to Schiller's Maid of Orleans, act 3, sc. 6:  "Against stupidity the gods themselves fight in vain.".


-------
Boredom
-------

Man finds nothing so intolerable as to be in a state of complete rest, without passions, without occupation, without diversion, without effort.  Then he feels his nullity, loneliness, inadequacy, dependence, helplessness, emptiness.


Blaise Pascal 
1623-62
French scientist, philosopher

Pensées  (1670; no. 622 ed. by Krailsheimer, no. 131 ed. by Brunschvicg).


-------
Boredom
-------

Boredom is. . . a vital problem for the moralist, since at least half the sins of mankind are caused by the fear of it.


Bertrand Russell 
1872-1970
British philosopher, mathematician

The Conquest of Happiness, ch. 4 (1930).


-------
Boredom
-------

Boredom is just the reverse side of fascination: both depend on being outside rather than inside a situation, and one leads to the other.


Susan Sontag 
b. 1933
U.S. essayist

On Photography,  "America, Seen Through Photographs, Darkly"  (1977).

-------------------------
--------- Color ---------
-------------------------

White. . . is not a mere absence of colour; it is a shining and affirmative thing, as fierce as red, as definite as black. . . . God paints in many colours; but He never paints so gorgeously, I had almost said so gaudily, as when He paints in white.


G. K. Chesterton

British author

Tremendous Trifles,  "A Piece of Chalk"  (1909).

English dramatist, poet

Amorphus, in Cynthia's Revels, act 5, sc. 2.


-----
Color
-----

Color possesses me.  I don't have to pursue it.  It will possess me always, I know it.  That is the meaning of this happy hour: Color and I are one.  I am a painter.


Paul Klee 
1879-1940
Swiss artist

The Diaries of Paul Klee 1898-1918  (1957: tr. 1965), entry for 16 April 1914, written in Tunisia.

The true colour of life is the colour of the body, the colour of the covered red, the implicit and not explicit red of the living heart and the pulses.  It is the modest colour of the unpublished blood.


Alice Meynell 
1847-1922
English poet, essayist

Essays,  "The True Colour of Life"  (1914).

Color
-----

Color is my day-long obsession, joy and torment.  To such an extent indeed that one day, finding myself at the deathbed of a woman who had been and still was very dear to me, I caught myself in the act of focusing on her temples and automatically analyzing the succession of appropriately graded colors which death was imposing on her motionless face.


Claude Monet 
1840-1926

Why do two colors, put one next to the other, sing?  Can one really explain this?  no.   Just as one can never learn how to paint.


Pablo Picasso 
1881-1973
Spanish artist

Arts de France, no. 6 (Paris; 1946; tr. in Dore Ashton, Picasso on Art, 1972).


-----
Color
-----

Painting is something that takes place among the colors, and. . . one has to leave them alone completely, so that they can settle the matter among themselves.  Their intercourse: this is the whole of painting.  Whoever meddles, arranges, injects his human deliberation, his wit, his advocacy, his intellectual agility in any way, is already disturbing and clouding their activity.


Rainer Maria Rilke

He had that curious love of green, which in individuals is always the sign of a subtle artistic temperament, and in nations is said to denote a laxity, if not a decadence of morals.

We are living in the machine age.  For the first time in history the comedian has been compelled to supply himself with jokes and comedy material to compete with the machine.  Whether he knows it or not, the comedian is on a treadmill to oblivion.

--------------------

--------------------

Today's comedian has a cross to bear that he built himself.  A comedian of the older generation did an "act" and he told the audience,  "This is my act."  Today's comic is not doing an act.  The audience assumes he's telling the truth.  What is truth today may be a damn lie next week.

--------------------
Comedy and Comedians
--------------------

The perception of the comic is a tie of sympathy with other men, a pledge of sanity, and a protection from those perverse tendencies and gloomy insanities in which fine intellects sometimes lose themselves.  A rogue alive to the ludicrous is still convertible.  If that sense is lost, his fellow-men can do little for him.

-----------
Complacency
-----------

I cannot help fearing that men may reach a point where they look on every new theory as a danger, every innovation as a toilsome trouble, every social advance as a first step toward revolution, and that they may absolutely refuse to move at all for fear of being carried off their feet. The prospect really does frighten me that they may finally become so engrossed in a cowardly love of immediate pleasures that their interest in their own future and in that of their descendants may vanish, and that they will prefer tamely to follow the course of their destiny rather than make a sudden energetic effort necessary to set things right.

Democracy in America, vol. 2, pt. 3, ch. 21 (1840).


-----------
Complacency
-----------

A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly attractive to men and women.  An Englishman is self-assured as being a citizen of the best-organized state in the world and therefore, as an Englishman, always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct.  An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people.  A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The German's self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the truth --science --which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth.

----------
Conscience
----------

When I contemplate the accumulation of guilt and remorse which, like a garbage-can, I carry through life, and which is fed not only by the lightest action but by the most harmless pleasure, I feel Man to be of all living things the most biologically incompetent and ill-organized.  Why has he acquired a seventy years' life-span only to poison it incurably by the mere being of himself?  Why has he thrown Conscience, like a dead rat, to putrefy in the well?

----------
Conscience
----------

In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide.  But sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung wide open.  In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror, imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or controlling them; then pray that your griefs may slumber, and the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain.

Conscience was the barmaid of the Victorian soul.  Recognizing that human beings were fallible and that their failings, though regrettable, must be humoured, conscience would permit, rather ungraciously perhaps, the indulgence of a number of carefully selected desires.

But that's always the way; it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. . . . It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer thinks the same.

Conscience

There are some women. . . in whom conscience is so strongly developed that it leaves little room for anything else.  Love is scarcely felt before duty rushes to encase it, anger impossible because one must always be calm and see both sides, pity evaporates in expedients, even grief is felt as a sort of bruised sense of injury, a resentment that one should have grief forced upon one when one has always acted for the best.

A Difficulty in the Path of Psycho-Analysis  (1917; repr. in Complete Works, vol. 17, ed. by James Strachey & Anna Freud, 1955). This was Freud's conclusion in light of the discoveries made by psychoanalysis that sexual instincts could not be wholly tamed, and that mental processes were unconscious and could "only reach the ego and come under its control through incomplete and untrustworthy perceptions."

----------------------------------

----------------------------------
Consciousness and the Subconscious
----------------------------------

Man is only a reed, the weakest in nature; but he is a thinking reed.  There is no need for the whole universe to take up arms to crush him: a vapor, a drop of water is enough to kill him.  But even if the universe were to crush him, man would still be nobler than his slayer, because he knows that he is dying and the advantage the universe has over him.  The universe knows nothing of this.

6th century B.C.

Greek fabulist

Fables,  "The Fly on the Wheel"  (tr. by Francis Bacon in his essay "Of Vain-Glory").


---------------------
Delusions of Grandeur
---------------------

The lunatic is the man who lives in a small world but thinks it is a large one; he is the man who lives in a tenth of the truth, and thinks it is the whole. The madman cannot conceive any cosmos outside a certain tale or conspiracy or vision. Hence the more clearly we see the world divided into Saxons and non-Saxons, into our splendid selves and the rest, the more certain we may be that we are slowly and quietly going mad. The more plain and satisfying our state appears, the more we may know that we are living in an unreal world. For the real world is not satisfying. The more clear become the colours and facts of Anglo-Saxon superiority, the more surely we may know we are in a dream.

------------------------------
--------- Depression ---------
------------------------------

Depression moods lead, almost invariably, to accidents. But, when they occur, our mood changes again, since the accident shows we can draw the world in our wake, and that we still retain some degree of power even when our spirits are low. A series of accidents creates a positively light-hearted state, out of consideration for this strange power.

----------
Depression
----------

The attitude of unhappiness is not only painful, it is mean and ugly. What can be more base and unworthy than the pining, puling, mumping mood, no matter by what outward ills it may have been engendered? What is more injurious to others? What less helpful as a way out of the difficulty? It but fastens and perpetuates the trouble which occasioned it, and increases the total evil of the situation. At all costs, then, we ought to reduce the sway of that mood; we ought to scout it in ourselves and others, and never show it tolerance.

Dictionaries
------------

Actually if a writer needs a dictionary he should not write. He should have read the dictionary at least three times from beginning to end and then have loaned it to someone who needs it. There are only certain words which are valid and similies (bring me my dictionary) are like defective ammunition (the lowest thing I can think of at this time).


Ernest Hemingway

So, too, if, to our surprise, we should meet one of these morons whose remarks are so conspicuous a part of the folklore of the world of the radio --remarks made without using either the tongue or the brain, spouted much like the spoutings of small whales --we should recognize him as below the level of nature but not as below the level of the imagination.

--------- Disillusion ---------
-------------------------------

The wise man, knowing how to enjoy achieved results without having constantly to replace them with others, finds in them an attachment to life in the hour of difficulty. But the man who has always pinned all his hopes on the future and lived with his eyes fixed upon it, has nothing in the past as a comfort against the present's afflictions, for the past was nothing to him but a series of hastily experienced stages. What blinded him to himself was his expectation always to find further on the happiness he had so far missed. Now he is stopped in his tracks; from now on nothing remains behind or ahead of him to fix his gaze upon.

Doctors

A doctor, like anyone else who has to deal with human beings, each of them unique, cannot be a scientist; he is either, like the surgeon, a craftsman, or, like the physician and the psychologist, an artist. . . . This means that in order to be a good doctor a man must also have a good character, that is to say, whatever weaknesses and foibles he may have, he must love his fellow human beings in the concrete and desire their good before his own.

Doctors

One of the fundamental reasons why so many doctors become cynical and disillusioned is precisely because, when the abstract idealism has worn thin, they are uncertain about the value of the actual lives of the patients they are treating. This is not because they are callous or personally inhuman: it is because they live in and accept a society which is incapable of knowing what a human life is worth.

There seems to be no stopping drug frenzy once it takes hold of a nation. What starts with an innocuous HUGS, NOT DRUGS bumper sticker soon leads to wild talk of shooting dealers and making urine tests a condition for employment --anywhere.

No monster vibration, no snake universe hallucinations.

If we could sniff or swallow something that would, for five or six hours each day, abolish our solitude as individuals, atone us with our fellows in a glowing exaltation of affection and make life in all its aspects seem not only worth living, but divinely beautiful and significant, and if this heavenly, world-transfiguring drug were of such a kind that we could wake up next morning with a clear head and an undamaged constitution --then, it seems to me, all our problems (and not merely the one small problem of discovering a novel pleasure) would be wholly solved and earth would become paradise.

To punish drug takers is like a drunk striking the bleary face it sees in the mirror.

One's condition on marijuana is always existential. One can feel the importance of each moment and how it is changing one. One feels one's being, one becomes aware of the enormous apparatus of nothingness --the hum of a hi-fi set, the emptiness of a pointless interruption, one becomes aware of the war between each of us, how the nothingness in each of us seeks to attack the being of others, how our being in turn is attacked by the nothingness in others.

Nature, more of a stepmother than a mother in several ways, has sown a seed of evil in the hearts of mortals, especially in the more thoughtful men, which makes them dissatisfied with their own lot and envious of another's.

----
Evil
----

Evil is neither suffering nor sin; it is both at the same time, it is something common to them both. For they are linked together; sin makes us suffer and suffering makes us evil, and this indissoluble complex of suffering and sin is the evil in which we are submerged against our will, and to our horror.

In short, no association or alliance can be happy or stable without me. People can't long tolerate a ruler, nor can a master his servant, a maid her mistress, a teacher his pupil, a friend his friend nor a wife her husband, a landlord his tenant, a soldier his comrade nor a party-goer his companion, unless they sometimes have illusions about each other, make use of flattery, and have the sense to turn a blind eye and sweeten life for themselves with the honey of folly.

The great God endows His children variously. To some he gives intellect --and they move the earth. To some he allots heart --and the beating pulse of humanity is theirs. But to some He gives only a soul, without intelligence --and these, who never grow up, but remain always His children, are God's fools, kindly, elemental, simple, as if from His palette the Artist of all had taken one colour instead of many.

Looking foolish does the spirit good. The need not to look foolish is one of youth's many burdens; as we get older we are exempted from more and more, and float upward in our heedlessness, singing Gratia Dei sum quod sum.

To place oneself in the position of God is painful: being God is equivalent to being tortured. For being God means that one is in harmony with all that is, including the worst. The existence of the worst evils is unimaginable unless God willed them.

To speak of God, to think of God, is in every respect to show what one is made of. . . . I have always wagered against God and I regard the little that I have won in this world as simply the outcome of this bet.

The psychoanalysis of individual human beings, however, teaches us with quite special insistence that the god of each of them is formed in the likeness of his father, that his personal relation to God depends on his relation to his father in the flesh and oscillates and changes along with that relation, and that at bottom God is nothing other than an exalted father.

Without doubt God is the universal moving force, but each being is moved according to the nature that God has given it. . . . He directs angels, man, animals, brute matter, in sum all created things, but each according to its nature, and man having been created free, he is freely led. This rule is truly the eternal law and in it we must believe.


Joseph De Maistre 
1753 --1821

God is the immemorial refuge of the incompetent, the helpless, the miserable. They find not only sanctuary in His arms, but also a kind of superiority, soothing to their macerated egos: He will set them above their betters.

If we really think about it, God exists for any single individual who puts his trust in Him, not for the whole of humanity, with its laws, its organizations, and its violence. Humanity is the demon which God does not succeed in destroying.

God
---

To me the sole hope of human salvation lies in teaching Man to regard himself as an experiment in the realization of God, to regard his hands as God's hand, his brain as God's brain, his purpose as God's purpose. He must regard God as a helpless Longing, which longed him into existence by its desperate need for an executive organ.

---
God
---

It is an insult to God to believe in God. For on the one hand it is to suppose that he has perpetrated acts of incalculable cruelty. On the other hand, it is to suppose that he has perversely given his human creatures an instrument --their intellect --which must inevitably lead them, if they are dispassionate and honest, to deny his existence. It is tempting to conclude that if he exists, it is the atheists and agnostics that he loves best, among those with any pretensions to education. For they are the ones who have taken him most seriously.

It seems to me that the god that is commonly worshipped in civilized countries is not at all divine, though he bears a divine name, but is the overwhelming authority and respectability of mankind combined. Men reverence one another, not yet God.

The guarantee that our self enjoys an intended relation to the outer world is most, if not all, we ask from religion. God is the self projected onto reality by our natural and necessary optimism. He is the not-me personified.

In relation to God, we are like a thief who has burgled the house of a kindly householder and been allowed to keep some of the gold. From the point of view of the lawful owner this gold is a gift; Form the point of view of the burglar it is a theft. He must go and give it back. It is the same with our existence. We have stolen a little of God's being to make it ours. God has made us a gift of it. But we have stolen it. We must return it.

In the faces of men and women I see God, and in

Others will punctually come for ever and ever.

When I hear the hypercritical quarreling about grammar and style, the position of the particles, etc., etc., stretching or contracting every speaker to certain rules of theirs. . . I see that they forget that the first requisite and rule is that expression shall be vital and natural, as much as the voice of a brute or an interjection: first of all, mother tongue; and last of all, artificial or father tongue. Essentially your truest poetic sentence is as free and lawless as a lamb's bleat.

False greatness is unsociable and remote: conscious of its own frailty, it hides, or at least averts its face, and reveals itself only enough to create an illusion and not be recognized as the meanness that it really is.

The world isn't kept running because it's a paying proposition.  (God doesn't make a cent on the deal.)  The world goes on because a few men in every generation believe in it utterly, accept it unquestioningly; they underwrite it with their lives.

---------
Greatness
---------

In historic events, the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself. Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity.

The vitamin has been reified. A chemical intangible originally defined as a unit of nutritive value, it was long ago reified into a pill.

Measure your health by your sympathy with morning and spring.

--------- Hell ---------
------------------------

Hell is out of fashion --institutional hells at any rate. The populated infernos of the 20th century are more private affairs, the gaps between the bars are the sutures of one's own skull. . . . A valid hell is one from which there is a possibility of redemption, even if this is never achieved, the dungeons of an architecture of grace whose spires point to some kind of heaven. The institutional hells of the present century are reached with one-way tickets, marked Nagasaki and Buchenwald, worlds of terminal horror even more final than the grave.

And what have you laymen made of hell?  A kind of penal servitude for eternity, on the lines of your convict prisons on earth, to which you condemn in advance all the wretched felons your police have hunted from the beginning --"enemies of society," as you call them. You're kind enough to include the blasphemers and the profane. What proud or reasonable man could stomach such a notion of God's justice?  And when you find that notion inconvenient it's easy enough for you to put it on one side. . . . Hell is not to love any more, madame. Not to love any more!

To be in a world which is a hell, to be of that world and neither to believe in or guess at anything but that world is not merely hell but the only possible damnation: the act of a man damning himself.

Listen, my friend, there are two races of beings. The masses teeming and happy --common clay, if you like --eating, breeding, working, counting their pennies; people who just live; ordinary people; people you can't imagine dead.

In our world of big names, curiously, our true heroes tend to be anonymous. In this life of illusion and quasi-illusion, the person of solid virtues who can be admired for something more substantial than his well-knownness often proves to be the unsung hero: the teacher, the nurse, the mother, the honest cop, the hard worker at lonely, underpaid, unglamorous, unpublicized jobs.

Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. . . . He is the hero, he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man.

He must be the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world.

A man can be a hero if he is a scientist, or a soldier, or a drug addict, or a disc jockey, or a crummy mediocre politician. A man can be a hero because he suffers and despairs; or because he thinks logically and analytically; or because he is "sensitive;" or because he is cruel. Wealth establishes a man as a hero, and so does poverty. Virtually any circumstance in a man's life will make him a hero to some group of people and has a mythic rendering in the culture --in literature, art, theater, or the daily newspapers.

Mankind's common instinct for reality. . . has always held the world to be essentially a theatre for heroism. In heroism, we feel, life's supreme mystery is hidden. We tolerate no one who has no capacity whatever for it in any direction. On the other hand, no matter what a man's frailties otherwise may be, if he be willing to risk death, and still more if he suffer it heroically, in the service he has chosen, the fact consecrates him forever.

The sick man must follow his illness to the place where it is treated. . . .

We achieve "active" mastery over illness and death by delegating all responsibility for their management to physicians, and by exiling the sick and the dying to hospitals. But hospitals serve the convenience of staff not patients: we cannot be properly ill in a hospital, nor die in one decently; we can do so only among those who love and value us. The result is the institutionalized dehumanization of the ill, characteristic of our age.

Humor, a good sense of it, is to Americans what manhood is to Spaniards and we will go to great lengths to prove it.

Any discussion of the problems of being funny in America will not make sense unless we substitute the word wit for humor.

Humor

Humor has been a fashioning instrument in America, cleaving its way through the national life, holding tenaciously to the spread elements of that life. Its mode has often been swift and coarse and ruthless, beyond art and beyond established civilization. It has engaged in warfare against the established heritage, against the bonds of pioneer existence. Its objective --the unconscious objective of a disunited people --has seemed to be that of creating fresh bonds, a new unity, the semblance of a society and the rounded completion of an American type.

A slightly different version of Thurber's aphorism was recorded as early as 1936, when it was attributed to him in Max Eastman, Enjoyment of Laughter:  "Humor is a kind of emotional chaos told about calmly and quietly in retrospect. There is always a laugh in the utterly familiar." See Wordsworth on POETRY for the origin of the quip.

Every American, to the last man, lays claim to a "sense" of humor and guards it as his most significant spiritual trait, yet rejects humor as a contaminating element wherever found.

-----
Ideas
-----

Ideas are powerful things, requiring not a studious contemplation but an action, even if it is only an inner action. Their acquisition obligates each man in some way to change his life, even if it is only his inner life. They demand to be stood for. They dictate where a man must concentrate his vision. They determine his moral and intellectual priorities. They provide him with allies and make him enemies. In short, ideas impose an interest in their ultimate fate which goes far beyond the realm of the merely reasonable.

It's very good for an idea to be commonplace. The important thing is that a new idea should develop out of what is already there so that it soon becomes an old acquaintance. Old acquaintances aren't by any means always welcome, but at least one can't be mistaken as to who or what they are.

-----
Ideas
-----

There are more ideas on earth than intellectuals imagine. And these ideas are more active, stronger, more resistant, more passionate than "politicians" think. We have to be there at the birth of ideas, the bursting outward of their force: not in books expressing them, but in events manifesting this force, in struggles carried on around ideas, for or against them. Ideas do not rule the world. But it is because the world has ideas. . . that it is not passively ruled by those who are its leaders or those who would like to teach it, once and for all, what it must think.

The value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.

An identity is questioned only when it is menaced, as when the mighty begin to fall, or when the wretched begin to rise, or when the stranger enters the gates, never, thereafter, to be a stranger. . . . Identity would seem to be the garment with which one covers the nakedness of the self: in which case, it is best that the garment be loose, a little like the robes of the desert, through which one's nakedness can always be felt, and, sometimes, discerned. This trust in one's nakedness is all that gives one the power to change one's robes.

Identity is a bag and a gag. Yet it exists for me with all the force of a fatal disease. Obviously I am here, a mind and a body. To say there's no proof my body exists would be arty and specious and if my mind is more ephemeral, less provable, the solution of being a writer with solid (touchable, tearable, burnable) books is as close as anyone has come to a perfect answer.

For what we call illusions are often, in truth, a wider vision of past and present realities --a willing movement of a man's soul with the larger sweep of the world's forces --a movement towards a more assured end than the chances of a single life.

People who have realized that this is a dream imagine that it is easy to wake up, and are angry with those who continue sleeping, not considering that the whole world that environs them does not permit them to wake.

For me, it is as though at every moment the actual world had completely lost its actuality. As though there was nothing there; as though there were no foundations for anything or as though it escaped us. Only one thing, however, is vividly present: the constant tearing of the veil of appearances; the constant destruction of everything in construction. Nothing holds together, everything falls apart.

Artists use frauds to make human beings seem more wonderful than they really are. Dancers show us human beings who move much more gracefully than human beings really move. Films and books and plays show us people talking much more entertainingly than people really talk, make paltry human enterprises seem important. Singers and musicians show us human beings making sounds far more lovely than human beings really make. Architects give us temples in which something marvelous is obviously going on. Actually, practically nothing is going on.

The visual is sorely undervalued in modern scholarship. Art history has attained only a fraction of the conceptual sophistication of literary criticism. . . .

Industrial societies turn their citizens into image-junkies; it is the most irresistible form of mental pollution. Poignant longings for beauty, for an end to probing below the surface, for a redemption and celebration of the body of the world.

To me this world is all one continued vision of fancy or imagination, and I feel flattered when I am told so. What is it sets Homer, Virgil and Milton in so high a rank of art?  Why is the Bible more entertaining and instructive than any other book?  Is it not because they are addressed to the imagination, which is spiritual sensation, and but mediately to the understanding or reason?

To reduce the imagination to a state of slavery --even though it would mean the elimination of what is commonly called happiness --is to betray all sense of absolute justice within oneself. Imagination alone offers me some intimation of what can be.

The genius of Man in our time has gone into jet-propulsion, atom-splitting, penicillin-curing, etc. There is none over for works of imagination; of spiritual insight or mystical enlightenment. I asked for bread and was given a tranquilliser.

It is eminently a weariable faculty, eminently delicate, and incapable of bearing fatigue; so that if we give it too many objects at a time to employ itself upon, or very grand ones for a long time together, it fails under the effort, becomes jaded, exactly as the limbs do by bodily fatigue, and incapable of answering any farther appeal till it has had rest.

Whenever we encounter the Infinite in man, however imperfectly understood, we treat it with respect.

To the artist is sometimes granted a sudden, transient insight which serves in this matter for experience. A flash, and where previously the brain held a dead fact, the soul grasps a living truth!  At moments we are all artists.

Out of the closets and into the museums, libraries, architectural monuments, concert halls, bookstores, recording studios and film studios of the world. Everything belongs to the inspired and dedicated thief. . . . Words, colors, light, sounds, stone, wood, bronze belong to the living artist. They belong to anyone who can use them. Loot the Louvre!  A bas l'originalité, the sterile and assertive ego that imprisons us as it creates. Vive le sol --pure, shameless, total. We are not responsible. Steal anything in sight.

Had it not been for you, I should have remained what I was when we first met, a prejudiced, narrow-minded being, with contracted sympathies and false knowledge, wasting my life on obsolete trifles, and utterly insensible to the privilege of living in this wondrous age of change and progress.

Most of us who turn to any subject we love remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down an untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker, or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the first traceable beginning of our love.

I didn't have to think up so much as a comma or a semicolon; it was all given, straight from the celestial recording room. Weary, I would beg for a break, an intermission, time enough, let's say, to go to the toilet or take a breath of fresh air on the balcony. Nothing doing!

--------- Intellect and Intellectuals ---------
-----------------------------------------------

I was asked to-night why I refuse to have truck with intellectuals after business hours. But of course I won't. 1. I am not an intellectual. Two minutes' talk with Aldous Huxley, William Glock, or any of the New Statesman crowd would expose me utterly. 2. I am too tired after my day's work to man the intellectual palisade.  3. When my work is finished I want to eat, drink, smoke, and relax. 4. I don't know very much, but what I do know I know better than anybody, and I don't want to argue about it. I know what I think about an actor or an actress, and am not interested in what anybody else thinks. My mind is not a bed to be made and re-made.

If intellection and knowledge were mere passion from without, or the bare reception of extraneous and adventitious forms, then no reason could be given at all why a mirror or looking-glass should not understand; whereas it cannot so much as sensibly perceive those images which it receives and reflects to us.

The work of an intellectual is not to mould the political will of others; it is, through the analyses that he does in his own field, to re-examine evidence and assumptions, to shake up habitual ways of working and thinking, to dissipate conventional familiarities, to re-evaluate rules and institutions and. . . to participate in the formation of a political will (where he has his role as citizen to play).

---------------------------
Intellect and Intellectuals
---------------------------

Our intellect is not the most subtle, the most powerful, the most appropriate, instrument for revealing the truth. It is life that, little by little, example by example, permits us to see that what is most important to our heart, or to our mind, is learned not by reasoning but through other agencies. Then it is that the intellect, observing their superiority, abdicates its control to them upon reasoned grounds and agrees to become their collaborator and lackey.


Marcel Proust

Reason is man's faculty for grasping the world by thought, in contradiction to intelligence, which is man's ability to manipulate the world with the help of thought.

My opposition [to interviews] lies in the fact that offhand answers have little value or grace of expression, and that such oral give and take helps to perpetuate the decline of the English language.

Invention

In my own time there have been inventions of this sort, transparent windows. . . tubes for diffusing warmth equally through all parts of a building. . . short-hand, which has been carried to such a perfection that a writer can keep pace with the most rapid speaker. But the inventing of such things is drudgery for the lowest slaves; philosophy lies deeper. It is not her office to teach men how to use their hands. The object of her lessons is to form the soul.

------------
Jesus Christ
------------

Never has any one been less a priest than Jesus, never a greater enemy of forms, which stifle religion under the pretext of protecting it. By this we are all his disciples and his successors; by this he has laid the eternal foundation-stone of true religion; and if religion is essential to humanity, he has by this deserved the Divine rank the world has accorded him.

Let us pardon him his hope of a vain apocalypse, and of a second coming in great triumph upon the clouds of heaven. Perhaps these were the errors of others rather than his own; and if it be true that he himself shared the general illusion, what matters it, since his dream rendered him strong against death, and sustained him in a struggle to which he might otherwise have been unequal?

There is but one love of Jesus, as there is but one person in the poor -- Jesus. We take vows of chastity to love Christ with undivided love; to be able to love him with undivided love we take a vow of poverty which frees us from all material possessions, and with that freedom we can love him with undivided love, and from this vow of undivided love we surrender ourselves totally to him in the person who takes his place.

Being a funny person does an awful lot of things to you. You feel that you mustn't get serious with people. They don't expect it from you, and they don't want to see it. You're not entitled to be serious, you're a clown, and they only want you to make them laugh.

The old idea that the joke was not good enough for the company has been superseded by the new aristocratic idea that the company was not worthy of the joke. They have introduced an almost insane individualism into that one form of intercourse which is specially and uproariously communal. They have made even levities into secrets.

Judgment

It is a purely relative matter where one draws the plimsoll-line of condemnation, and. . . if you find the whole of humanity falls below it you have simply made a mistake and drawn it too high. And are probably below it yourself.


Frances Partridge 
b. 1900
British translator, author

Julia, ch. 17 (1983), entry for 3 Sept. 1959.

Judgment

To say of men that they are bad is to say they are worse than we think we are, or worse than the ideal man whose image we have built up on the basis of a certain few.

Carnets d'un Biologiste  (repr. in The Substance of Man,, 1962, p. 195).

Judgment Day
------------

And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.


Bible: New Testament.
 



Revelation 20:12.


------------
Judgment Day
------------

A material resurrection seems strange and even absurd except for purposes of punishment, and all punishment which is to revenge rather than correct must be morally wrong, and when the World is at an end, what moral or warning purpose can eternal tortures answer?


Lord Byron 
1788 --1824
English poet

Detached Thoughts, no. 96 (1821 --22; published in Byron's Letters and Journals, vol. 9, ed. by Leslie A. Marchand, 1979).

Judgment Day

------------
Judgment Day
------------

When the sun shall be darkened,
when the stars shall be thrown down,
when the mountains shall be set moving,
when the pregnant camels shall be neglected,
when the savage beasts shall be mustered,
when the seas shall be set boiling,
when the souls shall be coupled,
when the buried infant shall be asked for what sin
  she was slain,
when the scrolls shall be unrolled,
when the heaven shall be stripped off,
when Hell shall be set blazing,
when Paradise shall be brought nigh,
then shall a soul know what it has produced.


Qur'An.
 



The Darkening 81:1 --14 (ed. by Arthur J. Arberry, 1955)

 "Write that down," the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.


Lewis Carroll

Juries

Our civilization has decided. . . that determining the guilt or innocence of men is a thing too important to be trusted to trained men. . . . When it wants a library catalogued, or the solar system discovered, or any trifle of that kind, it uses up its specialists. But when it wishes anything done which is really serious, it collects twelve of the ordinary men standing round. The same thing was done, if I remember right, by the Founder of Christianity.


G. K. Chesterton 
1874 --1936
British author

Tremendous Trifles,  "The Twelve Men"  (1909).

Juries

I'm no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury system -- that is no ideal to me, it is a living, working reality. Gentlemen, a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury. A court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up.


Harper Lee 
b. 1926
U.S. author

Atticus Finch, in To Kill a Mockingbird, pt. 2, ch. 20 (1960), in his speech to the jury.

May have in the sworn twelve a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try.

Angelo, in Measure for Measure, act 2, sc. 1.
