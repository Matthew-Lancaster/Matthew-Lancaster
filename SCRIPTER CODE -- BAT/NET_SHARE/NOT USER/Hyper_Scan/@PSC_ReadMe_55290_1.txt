Title: Hyper Scanner 1.0 port scanner
Description: This is designed to be a fast(er) port scanner, configurable (pipelines, timeouts) and automatic (scans Class D or C level ranges). It uses Winsock arrays to make pipelines to test ports. Works very well on a LAN, and has good to excellent success on the Internet, in my testing anyways. The code demonstrates using arrays of controls, etc. This is my first submission to PSCode.com, please enjoy!
