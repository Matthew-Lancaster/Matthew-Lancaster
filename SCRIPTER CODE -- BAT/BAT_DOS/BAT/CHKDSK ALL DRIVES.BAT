REM -- THIS WILL RUN CHKDSK ON ALL DRIVES -- IN READ ONLY MODE
REM -- WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE IT CAN CHECK WITHOUT REQUIRE TO UNLOCK ACCESS
REM -- 
REM -- LEAVING BEHIND A EMPTY TAG ROOT FILE - YOU CAN SET TO DELETE AFTER IF YOU WANT
REM -- OR YOU MAY WANT THE TIME WHEN LAST RUN LEFT THERE
REM -- AND THEN CHKNTFS WILL MAKE A ERRORLEVEL IF THE DISK IS DIRTY BIT SET
REM -- ANSWER ON THAT IS TO INFORM YOU TO RUN CHKDSK /F OR CHKNTFS WITH /C SET 
REM -- FOR CHECK AT NEXT BOOT - BUT BECAUSE ERRORLEVER - CAN HAVE THAT JOB 
REM -- TAKE OUT OF YOUR HANDS

REM -- WORTH NOTING CAN'T DO EXIT MID WAY IN BATCH FILE
REM -- ALSO IF THE (ALL DRIVES) DRIVE IS SET TO DO MANUAL CHKDSK AT REBOOT THEN SHOWS AS THAT 
REM -- AND THEN DON'T REPORT DIRTY BIT STATUS AS A ERRORLEVEL SET- 
REM -- MAYBE IF YOU RUN TWICE BEFORE REBOOT

REM -- CAN CONFIRM ERRORS CAN BE FOUND AND NOT DIRTY BIT SET - BUT GOOD YOU CAN DO THAT
REM -- DOS WINDOWS STILL LEFT OPEN TYPE CHKNTFS /C(DRIVELETTER):

REM -- ALSO I NOTICED A DRIVE WITH CHAINS LOST TO RECOVER BUT DIDN'T SHOW AS DIRTY BIT SET

REM -- ALSO Noticed A DRIVE WITH ERROR IN READ ONLY MODE BUT NOT WITH CHKDSK /F MAYBE SOME FILES 
REM -- CHANGING WHILE ATTEMPT THE CHECKING IN READ ONLY MODE

REM -- ONE GOOD THING WHILE TESTING IT'S EASY TO QUIT CHKDSK WHEN IN READ ONLY MODE
REM -- IT'S GOOD TO CHECK DRIVE IN READ ONLY FIRST 1 REASON IF NOT GOT ENOUGH FRIVE SPACE TO COMPLETE JOB WHEN REPORTS NOT ENOUGH SPACE

REM -------------------------
REM -- THOUGHT I WROTE BEFORE BUT CHKDSK ON THE DRIVE YOUR ON WHILE EXAMPLE WITH CHKDSK /F REQUIRES UNLOCK AND
REM -- NOTICED IN ONE CASE REQUIRE THE CMOONAD WINDOW NOT TO BE ON THE DRIVE DOING CHKDSK ON
REM -- WILL HAVE TO MAKE CHKDSK FROM A INDEPENDENT DRIVE
REM ---------------------------------------------------------------
REM -- OOH - PUT TEXT IN WRONG FILE FOUND AGAIN YOU CAN READ DOUBLE FOR MOMENT ----
REM -- ANOTHER LAST CONCLUTION PROBLEM
REM -- CHKNTFS /C OPTION DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE DRIVE WILL BE CHECK AT BOOT
REM -- TRUE BY THE DOCUMENTATION HELP OF COMMAND ALSO I BELIEVE
REM -- EVEN WHEN CHKDSK READ ONLY FOUND FAULTS
REM -- SO RUN CHKDSK /F WHILE STILL BOOTED IF LOCKED AND THEN WILL ASK TO DO AT REBOOT

REM -- ADD THE OPTION TO ASK QUESTION AT END MAYBE - MIGHT DO
REM -- I DON'T WORRY ABOUT BEING ON DRIVE WHEN CHKDSK UNLOCKING THE DRIVE UNLOCKING 
REM -- THAT IS A MINOR PROBLEM
