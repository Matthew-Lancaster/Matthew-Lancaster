Hi Room
This One I'm Liker __ NIFTYWINDOWS.AHK
I Was Just Looker For Hot Key Minimize US_Speller a Window
and Found Here
and Long Before I Was Tester
7plus V.2.5.0 X64
It was an AutoHotKey Compiled Full Program
But After Access Report the Thing Lost The Text on Screen and got an Assemble Scrapbook of What is Left
Just Near End was a Difficult Bit About USE the JOYPAD that Wasn't Fully Explained __ Later to That One
------------------------------------------
And Notice All the Time Had this Little Bit of NiftyWindows Included In

Although I Did Not Find Have Minimize Window on Hot Key
Shall Find That in Source Code
These WizKid Knocking Out Code after Code

Has It Wither Left and Right Mouse Clicker
Few Good Thing to Pick Up
1..
ALT AND WHEEL 
RESIZE A WINDOW LIKE ZOOM
GOOD FOR LOST OF THE EDGE
2..
RIGHT BUTTON AND WHEEL
GOOD TASK MANAGER SYSTEM
QUICKER
3..CTRL AND RIGHT BUTTON
DO A GOOD MOVE ON OBJECT OF FORM LIKE RESIZE AND BETTER FOR POSITIONING AND CLICK IN CENTER OF FORM WILL MAKE WHOLE MOVING AROUND AND CLICK WITH CTRL NEAR RIGHT AND SO-ON WILL DRAG OUT THAT WAY OR BACK

FEW OTHER THING FOUND

NOTEPAD++ HAS AN MOUSEWHEEL AND RIGHT PRESS TO SELECT ANOTHER DOCUMENT QUICKER

NEW FIND WAS ALT AND IN EXPLORER FOR EXAMPLE WITH MOUSEWHEEL UP AND DOWN A BIT WILL SHOW WHERE ALL HOTKEY ARE LIKE IN TOOLTIP FOR QUICKER ACCESS

AND ALSO, MISTAKE BEFORE MESSENGER POST Here
Yes I Thinker 
Long Before
Lost My Train Of Thought a Minute to Finder Again
Sure It Was This One
The Visual Basic Mouse Wheel Also Left on My LinkedIn Recently
and Look For Code at Planet Source Code Other Day
Few Thing Unable to Find How to Do As Usual Look Virtually Impossible
and Would Take RSI Injury Out
Thanks Microsofter
and I have Been Prep All The Time
and Found By Microsoft a Bit Of Complex Looking Code to Repair the mouse-wheel Never Work in Visual Basic
Suffer Impossible Task of GUI-ING without that thing
Later Came KatMouse
and I Coded a Complex Looper Off when On and On When Off
at Planet Source Coder
They Have a Toolbar to Add
and Explain All How to Put On
But Never Worked as 64 Bit Problem I Thinker With Directory Placer and SYSWOW64 Folder Change From System32 Now Both Detect That Way
Look For Special System Folder and If SYSWOW64 Arrive on Certain One
Then Quick Detector
and Also To Learn if in Admin Mode As Get Special System Folder Command Won't Work It Error Level Breaker Back
Got That Far
And while At Instruction For Adding
Saw The New MouseWheel Was There At the Add-in Menu Loaded It Up and Worker
And They Don't Tell You None
Instant Mouse Wheel
-------------------------------------------

Yes Getting Back EDITOR
The Setup.exe Come Also With Source Code in AutoHotKeys Unpack Zip
But And Finger
If Copy to Folder Somewhere
I Found Rather Than Folder With Version Number To Replace of Update
in a Single Folder
You Have to Include All These File
Or It Will Startup Will Begin Suspended

Just Remember 
The TOT Train Of Thought Losser
Was To Do With The Logitech Mouse
Where the Flip Left and Right Wheel Do a Good Zoom in Out 
But Reset to Default Without-er Quite Often Happen
You Can Get Around It With Press Control Key and Wheel
To Do The Same
And Ctrl and naught Key 0 
To Reset back to 100%
But Rather Without Keyboard
And More Jerky That Way
Later I Will Sort the Scripter For That Thing
Been Having Trouble Sorting Other
Got a New Web Page on Google With All My Script Code
Happening Arrive Soon
I Don't Publish Them Anymore
Becuase they are Not Final Version
They Ought to Be Updated Lightning Quick With Changer

Butter And I Won't Get Any Hitt Counter
So Be Completely Free Any Value Of Reward
My Advert
I Learn The Lad & Lasses Like It Batch File Command Language

I Had a Domain For a Decade With a Lot Of Experiencer
WWW
But Cost £15 a Year and £15 a Year to Domain Park-er It
Now I Find I Able to Get Both From France at £0.99 Each

And then I Was Always In Hassle to Improver Expand to Allow Traffic Volume at Cost Extra Expensive

That Was on the Linux Apache system
