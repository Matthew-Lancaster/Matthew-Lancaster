    * 2005/07/02 Version 0.9.3.1

      [UPD]
          Updated the documentation.

      [UPD]
          Updated AutoHotkey to version 1.0.36.01.

      [UPD]
          Updated UPX (packer for executables) to version 1.25. Files
          that were packed and encrypted with the old UPX version 1.24
          (as NiftyWindows before) might confuse (alerted by mistake)
          some security software. The current version of NiftyWindows
          isn't encrypted anymore but still compressed using UPX version
          1.25.

      [FIX]
          Fixed /CTRL+WIN+S/ to enable power management after screen
          saver activation. This feature is very useful if you already
          know that you are going to leave the system for a long period
          of time.

    * 2005/03/14 Version 0.9.3

      [UPD]
          Updated the documentation.

      [UPD]
          Updated AutoHotkey to version 1.0.30.03.

      [IMP]
          Provided several minor improvements to most features.

      [UPD]
          Released the full source code under the GNU General Public
          License (GPL) <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.

      [ADD]
          Provided a 'X Window' like focus switching by mouse cursor
          movement. After activation of this feature (by using the
          responsible entry in the tray icon menu) the focus will follow
          the mouse cursor with a delayed focus change (after movement
          end) of 500 milliseconds (half a second). This feature is
          disabled per default to avoid any confusion due to the new
          user-interface-flow.

      [ADD]
          Provided some new hotkeys to organize and access your process
          windows in semantic groups quickly. Use /CTRL+WIN+F1..F24/ to
          add all windows of the active process to the responsible group
          and use /WIN+F1..F24/ to step through the group easily. Take a
          look in the readme for further details of this innovative feature.

    * 2005/02/28 Version 0.9.2

      [UPD]
          Updated the documentation.

      [UPD]
          Updated AutoHotkey to version 1.0.29.

      [ADD]
          Provided a global hotkey (/CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE/) to remove
          *all* visual effects (like on exit) that have been made before
          by NiftyWindows. You can use this action as fall-back solution
          to revert any always-on-top, rolled windows and transparency
          features you've set before quickly.

      [ADD]
          Provided many new features to adjust several transparency
          settings of your windows. Especially the pixel (not window)
          transparency is unknown to most people and can now be used
          easily by NiftyWindows. Take a look in the readme to join this
          complex feature.

      [ADD]
          Provided some new hotkeys (/WIN+0..9/) to open and close the
          drive trays of the installed CD/DVD-ROM readers/writers. The
          hotkeys are used in the sequence of the key placement on your
          physical keyboard from left to right (1 refers to the first
          and 0 to the tenth drive).

      [ADD]
          Provided a tooltip feedback for most of the NiftyWindows
          features. These tooltips can be enabled or disabled by
          clicking the responsible entry in the tray menu. The current
          setting is stored in the applications ini file to make it
          persistent (application directory). [thanks Ronald]

      [ADD]
          Provided an easy to use resize mode (/ALT+WHEEL/) to change
          the size of the active window in steps of 10 or 1 percent.

      [ADD]
          Provided a web aware resize mode (/ALT+NumAdd/NumSub/) to
          change the size of the active window in steps of the standard
          screen resolutions. /ALT+NumAdd/ increases to the next higher,
          /ALT+NumSub/ decreases to the previous lower resolution.
          [thanks Ronald]

      [ADD]
          Provided a check for update service (menu entry and monthly
          reminder) to stay easily up to date with all NiftyWindows
          features. NiftyWindows does never perform any update check
          without your interactive admission before the check.

      [ADD]
          Provided a tray icon (with menu) that contains several
          interaction components. You can disable the mouse hooks for
          all buttons separately in the responsible submenu to keep the
          original behaviour of any button. This makes sense if you need
          some special handling provided by some applications like
          Internet Explorer or Mozilla/Firefox (e.g. previous/next on
          fourth and fifth mouse button or close-tab on middle).

      [UPD]
          Changed the always on top hotkey from /CTRL+^/ to /WIN+^/.

      [IMP]
          Provided an additional hotkey (/CTRL+WIN+S/) to launch the
          screensaver with the addition that the display(s) will be
          powered down shortly (five seconds) after the screensaver
          started successfully. This feature is very useful if you
          already know that you are going to leave the system for a long
          period of time. [thanks Christian]

    * 2005/01/28 Version 0.9.1

      [UPD]
          Updated the documentation.

      [UPD]
          Updated AutoHotkey to version 1.0.25.09.

      [ADD]
          Provided a forced mode modifier (/CTRL/) to use the window
          interactions independently of the current window state. With
          this forced mode you can drag and resize the special windows
          specified in the readme (makes sense) as well as adjust the
          bounds of context menus and other (naturally) unchangeable GUI
          components (be careful). [thanks Daniel]

      [ADD]
          Provided a new feature combination to roll windows up to their
          titlebars. Press /RIGHT_BUTTON+LEFT_BUTTON/ over the caption
          of a window to roll it up instead of minimize it (normal
          behaviour). You have to apply this action again to roll the
          window back down. [thanks Daniel]

      [ADD]
          Provided a new mouse button combination
          (/RIGHT_BUTTON+MIDDLE_BUTTON/) to close the selected window as
          if you click the close button in the titlebar.

      [ADD]
          Provided a new feature combination to send the selected window
          to the bottom of the windows stack. Press
          /RIGHT_BUTTON+MIDDLE_BUTTON/ over the caption of a window to
          use this action. [thanks Carsten]

      [ADD]
          Provided two hotkeys (/CTRL+SHIFT+B/ and /CTRL+SHIFT+U/) to
          control the visibility of Miranda's buddy list and message
          windows. This feature is applied only if the Miranda
          executable can be found at: %ProgramFiles%\Miranda\Miranda32.exe

      [UPD]
          Changed the modifier for the virtual grid from /CTRL/ to
          /SHIFT/ (due to the new forced mode).

      [UPD]
          Changed the key/mouse combination for the alt-tab-menu from
          /CTRL+WHEEL/ to /RIGHT_BUTTON+WHEEL/. [thanks Stephen]

      [UPD]
          Updated the list (dragging disabled) of certain windows whose
          mouse behaviour may have a special handling controlled by the
          application. Currently the following windows (and its possible
          child windows) have been taken into account:

          Windows Explorer; Cabinet; Internet Explorer; Mozilla/Firefox;
          Opera; Xplore

      [IMP]
          All popup menus/windows are excluded from dragging (otherwise
          you can drag around the start or context menus which is funny
          but does not make any sense) (see forced mode).

      [IMP]
          By now the toggle maximize feature does not work on windows
          that do not provide the maximize button in the titlebar (see
          forced mode).

      [IMP]
          By now the resize feature does not work on windows that do not
          provide a thick frame for the normal resize operation (see
          forced mode).

      [FIX]
          Fixed the visual update effects of VMWare (and similar) windows.

    * 2005/01/04 Version 0.9

          This is the first public release of NiftyWindows (using
          AutoHotkey version 1.0.24).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    TODO

This list is incomplete, but contains the most important things.

    * Extend the configuration menu to enable/disable all features
      separately.

    * Make the eject drive feature operating simultaneously to
      open/close multiple drives at the same time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    KNOWN PROBLEMS

If the area (see below) in this section is empty there are currently no
known unsolved problems. Please be aware that there *may* be unknown
problems.

    * There are some visual problems when using the transparency
      features on Java windows (JFrame, JWindow, JDialog, etc.). You can
      fix this easily by adding the following VM parameter to the java
      command line:

      java -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true (...)
