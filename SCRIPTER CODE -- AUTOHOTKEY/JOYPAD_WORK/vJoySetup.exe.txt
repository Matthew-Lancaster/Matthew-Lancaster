These Zip Come From On-Line

Find in a Minute

Was Quite a Search Down
Missing Link URL
At the Moment

In order to use the the SHK script for JOy Control
The Driver Has to Be Installed

Problems I Had

The Driver is a Simulator

And It Got One Driver Name
Microsoft Something or Other

Also I Still Never Found How to Use AHK to Detect Which JoyPad was Plugged in By Device Name
They All Report as Microsoft Driver

Which Rather Annoying to Program Code
and Use Maximum of Joy Pad Button for Digital Imputing

Only Way For Me Is Do that thing On Visual Basic 
With a Logitech Controller and Software
Of Which You Can Use Any JoyPad Not Just Logitech
Which the Software Which Partly Found On line and Via Logitech

The JoyPad Controller Here
Is Good if You Want to Swap Buttons I Guess
That Has Working OKAY
But If You Press a Button on One Control and Want to to Translate to Press Another Button 
I'm Not Sure If You Get Two Press Actually
Far as I Got
