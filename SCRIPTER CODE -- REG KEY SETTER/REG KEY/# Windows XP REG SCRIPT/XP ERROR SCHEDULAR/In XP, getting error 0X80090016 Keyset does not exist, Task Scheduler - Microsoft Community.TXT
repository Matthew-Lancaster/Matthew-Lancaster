Hi,
I would suggest you to follow the steps provided in the below link and check if they help in resolving the issue.
Step 1:
Set Protected Storage to Automatic and verify the Status is started.  
1. Click Start.  
2. Choose Run.  
3. In the Run box, type services.msc.  
4. Click OK.  
5. Find the Protected Storage service, and right-click to select it.  
6. Select Properties.  
7. In the Startup Type list, select Automatic. (THIS WAS MY EXISTING SETTING) 
8. Verify the service Status is Started. (IT WAS STARTED) 
9. Click OK. 

Step 2:
Delete the files in Safe Mode   
1. Restart the computer.  
2. Keep pressing the F8 key until the Windows Startup menu appears.  
3. Choose Safe Mode, and press Enter.   
4. Start your computer in Safe mode. 
5. Double-click My Computer, and then click Folder Options on the Tools menu.  
(THERE WAS NO "My Computer" on the desktop - used Start -> My Computer) 
6. On the View tab, click to select Show hidden files and folders, and then click OK.   
7. Delete all of the files in the "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-18" folder. 
(THERE WAS ONLY ONE FILE) 

TRY YOUR USER - THIS ONE IS NOT EXIST HERE
AND DO ALL THE USER OF -- C:\Documents and Settings\

WRITE THE CODE

C:\Documents and Settings\MATT 04\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-21-329068152-842925246-839522115-1015


8. Restart your computer, and then run the task scheduler. 
9. Re-enter the password for the user running each job.
  (“Right click" -> run now executes the job. And they now also run as scheduled)
