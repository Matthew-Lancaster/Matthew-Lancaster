I CREATE THESE TWO FOLDER

ONE IS 
NUMBER 01
AND OTHER 
NUMBER 02 
FOR PAIR

AND THEN IN THE FOLDER 
IS NUMBER DIRECTORY
LIKE 001
AND THEN THEY MATCH PAIR IN MAIN SYNC_FOLDER 01 AND 02

WHEN A FILE GOES IN 001 EXAMPLE
AND ANOTHER IN MATCH PAIR 001
LIKE HERE
C:\SCRIPTER\SYNC_FOLDER_1\001\BAT 59-RUN GOODSYNC SET SCRIPTOR.BAT
C:\SCRIPTER\SYNC_FOLDER_2\001\BAT 45-SCRIPT RUN GITHUB - GOODSYNC.BAT

THESE TOW FILE HAVE DIFFERENT NAME
BUT ARE GOING TO BE SYNC_ER
WITH GOOD SYNC
AND MY LITTLE CODE THAT COMES IN HERE

C:\SCRIPTER\SCRIPTER CODE -- VBS\VBS 32-COPIER_SYNC.VBS

A SIMPLE LOOK UP AND CHECK DATE IT WILL LEARN WHICH ONE IS NEWER
AND REPLACE THEM ONTO EACH OTHER
AND THEN GOODSYNC WILL COME ALONG A DECIDE IT IF THEY ARE IN CONFLICT

THE FOLDER NEVER USE FOR WORKING
JUST MY METHOD TO SYNC PAIR THAT NOT SAME FILE NAME
OR MAYBE THEY ARE BUT SAME LEVEL FOLDER OR RECURSIVELY UNABLE TO REACH THEM
