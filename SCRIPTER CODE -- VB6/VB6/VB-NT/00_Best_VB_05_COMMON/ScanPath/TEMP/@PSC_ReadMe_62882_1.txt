Title: ScanPath 2.0
Description: High Performance API based file/folder scanner. Single File solution to quickly add file processing to any Utility Project. Scans a path applying Attribute, Mask, Date and Size filters. Optionally scan nested sub-folders and sort results. Supports simple Pattern Matching &amp; multiple file extensions. Returns the files &amp; folders by raising events. I originally created this a few years ago when I was creating many File Utilities. Hope it may be useful as example of API file handling and WithEvents. I welcome feedback (votes always appreciated)!
