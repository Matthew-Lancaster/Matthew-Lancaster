Title: Long Filename to Short Filename AND Short Filename to Long Filename
Description: Microsoft DOS used short file names as it could not support more than a certain length of characters, this program and its modules can be useful if you want to use a file in DOS but has a longer than DOS supported file name.
The idea is that you convert the Windows compatitible filename to a dos file name or a 'short file name' for use in DOS applications.
