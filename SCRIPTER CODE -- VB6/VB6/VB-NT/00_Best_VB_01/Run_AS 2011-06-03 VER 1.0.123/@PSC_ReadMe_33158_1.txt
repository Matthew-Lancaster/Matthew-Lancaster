Title: Windows 2000/XP Run As without having to Type a password class
Description: This class enhances the brillant Run as command which ships
with Windows 2000/XP Run As allows you to Run a program as any user 
without the need to log on and off. 
My RunAs class allows Network Admins to use Run as without having to type in a password this
means you can run a batch file using run as with no user input.
This class uses the API code from my forthcoming RunApp product the only different
is my final product will allow admins to create encrypted files which can be passed into the 
excuteable so the username and password won't be exposed in a batch or VBScript file. 
To use this class compile it on the server or client you wish to use it 
on. Register it using regsvr32 "Path to compiled runas.dll" at the command prompt.
