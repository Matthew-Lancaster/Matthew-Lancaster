Hi Friend

Found My Camera Sony Cyber Shot HX60V

Be Kind to Return It
It Cost Me £200
and It is My Forth One Including One First was Ericsson Mobile CyberShot K800i 
I had K700i W880i Following that Line

All Lost AND Broke Before

Even With Insurance for Damage 
It Don't Cover for a Lose at PCWorld -- Currys

Found Yourself a Present
I Left One on a Bus 700
Not a Return

Post My Media Card Back If You Want
Sure I can Go Half on the Value £100 Reward 
if You want It that Way
