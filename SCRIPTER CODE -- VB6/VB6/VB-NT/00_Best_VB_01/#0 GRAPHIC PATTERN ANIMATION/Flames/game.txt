	If you want to take part in one of the most incredible computer gaming experiences available, Genesis Entertainment L.C. is currently working on Realms of Time, a state-of-the-art RPG designed to revolutionize the gaming world.  If you or anyone you know has experience in C++ or excellent skills in VB graphic or text programming, or if you just want to hear the details of this incredible project, contact me at the e-mail address listed below.  Beta testers will be needed at some point in the future (NOT NOW, though, so don't ask for now!), so if you want to be on the list of candidates, contact me with a PROFESSIONAL resume detailing your experience.
	Also, and most importantly, we are looking for a talented 3D Graphics designer to help us with the many characters, both human and non-human, that will be needed for our game.  We are currently working on producing our own, but because our immediate focus is on scripting out the details of the storyline and building peripheral programs (like the map, magic, item, and character editors), we don't have a lot of time to spend on our graphics.  We are specifically looking for two types of 3D Graphics - characters (humans, monsters, etc.) that are similar to the style of Diablo characters (i.e. very nicely done at a small size, so huge amounts of close-up details aren't necessary), and 3D CG movies (we are aiming for CG graphics similar to those in Final Fantasy 7, and hopefully Final Fantasy 8, although those kind of graphics are most likely far out of our (or anyone but SquareSoft's) reach) with the same creatures mentioned above, except life-size and totally realistic.  If you or anyone you know may be interested, contact the Realms of Time production team at realmsoftime@usa.net.
