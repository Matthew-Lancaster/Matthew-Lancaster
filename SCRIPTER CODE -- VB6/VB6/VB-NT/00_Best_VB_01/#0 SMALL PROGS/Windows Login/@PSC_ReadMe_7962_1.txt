Title: E-Winlog
Description: This tiny app keeps track of when Windows95 is started and when
it is shut down and who was logged on in the period. 
It creates a log file which by default is named
E-WinLog.sys and placed in the Windows System directory unless anything
else is specified on the command line.
The log file is written in standard Windows text (.txt) format.
The log file contains one line per login/logout.
The app has no userinterface.
E-Winlog runs in the background at all times, but it uses very little 
system resources. It is invisible in the tasklist,
so the user has no way to detect it.
