Title: [BreakoutDX] 
Description: I think every would be indie game developer has to get a pong/breakout game out of their system.. this one is mine
How to play:
Click the left mouse button to fire the ball from
the paddle twoards the rows of bricks. The object
is to keep the ball in play by bouncing it off the
paddle until all of the bricks are destroyed.
When that happens the level is cleared, a bonus is
awarded and a new row of bricks is presented.
Capturing the ball:
Once the blue meter below the score is full, 
chime is sounded and the ball can be retreived.
To retreive the ball, click the left mouse button
and the ball will turn blue and stick to the
paddle. It is now ready to be re-fired.
At any time you can hit the Esc key to exit the
game.
Extra ball awarded at 80,000 points.
DirectX7 or better is required, along with a soundcard.
Other features:
Sound effects and shameless self promoting splashscreens (with beatz!)
High score keeper.
Known bugs:
The paddle can move much faster than the ball, which will lead to possible collision issues if the side of the paddle hits the ball really fast.
Misc:
The ball must reunite with the paddle for the level to be cleared. So if a ball is lost after the last brick is destroyed, you'll need to re-fire.
There's other features I wanted to add to this game, but other projects are taking up my time
Features that come to mind are:
Top 10 score list with name entry.
Multiball
Different block patterns.
Probably more I'm forgetting
