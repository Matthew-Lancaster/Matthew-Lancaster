Skin:         System Shock 2 (v1.3)
Release date: 21st of May 2000

Description:
------------
 "Tri-Optimum presents the next generation in cybernetic enhancements! Tri-Amp! Tri-Optimum Corp. will not be held responsible for injury while operating Tri-Amp under hazardous environment. Rock-rock!"

 This is actually my first skin - no, don't go! EVERYTHING is replaced: The mainwindow, playlist, equalizer and the minibrowser (and now the AVS). IMHO, I'm quite pleased with the results, but who wouldn't. :)

 And if you haven't tried System Shock 2 - do yourself a favour and support a great game by buying it. Or atleast get the demo. Thanks.

Thanks:
-------
 To the folks at www.sshock2.com and the bloke from Looking Glass Studios. (or was it Irrational? Damn that e-mail client for crashing. :P) And to the folk who commented my work. Thanks to them. Nice one.

How-to-install:
---------------
A)
 Stick this zip into your skins-directory

 -OR-

B)
 Create a directory called 'SystemShock2' in your skins-directory and unpack all the stuff into it.

 Acquire the skin from the menus of WinAmp - AND FALL TO THE AWESOME MIGHT OF OUR GODDESS SHODAN! BWAHAHAHAHAA!! ... Ahem.
