Book
This historic book may have numerous typos and missing text. Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1860 edition. Excerpt: ...Who pluckes me by the beard, or twites my nose, Giue's me the lie i'th throate downe to the lungs, Sure I should take it, or else I haue no gall, See p. II42 Or by this I should a fatted all the region kites With this flaues offell, this damned villaine, Treacherous, bawdy, murderous villaine: Why this is braue, that I the sonne of my deare father, Should like a scalion, like a very drabbe Thus raile in wordes. About my braine, I haue heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play, Prince of Denmarke. No trauiler returnes, puzzels the will, And makes vs rather beare those ills we haue, Then flie to others that we know not of. Thus conscience dooes make cowards, And thus the natiue hiew of resolution Is sickled ore with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pitch and moment, With this regard theyr currents turne awry, And loose the name of action. Soft you now, The faire Ophelia, Nimph in thy orizons Be all my sinnes remembred. Op h. Good my Lord, How dooes your honour for this many a day? Ham. I humbly thanke you well. Oph. My Lord, I haue remembrances of yours That I haue longed long to redeliuer, Oph. My honored Lord, you know right well you did, And with them words of so sweet breath composd As made these things more rich, their perfume lost, Take these againe, for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poore when giuers prooue vnkind, There my Lord. Ham. Ha, ha, are you honest. Oph. My Lord. Ham. Are you faire? Oph. What meanes your Lordship? Ham. That if you be honest & faire, you should admit no discourse to your beautie. Oph. Could beauty my Lord haue better comerse Then with honestie? Ham. I truly, for the power of beautie will sooner transsorme honestie from what it is to a bawde, then the force of honestie can translate...

This is a brand new edition of the smallest dictionary in Oxford's core range of dictionaries. The Oxford English Minidictionary is the ideal quick-reference tool. It is small and portable - slipping easily into a bag or briefcase. It is affordable and robust - its flexicover means that it resists wearing out, even though it is used all the time. This new edition of the Minidictionary is based on the latest research from the Oxford English Corpus: entries give the most common meanings first, making them more accessible and easy to understand than ever before, and definitions for core, topical, and technical vocabulary are informed by the most frequent 5,000 words in the Corpus. A brand-new design makes the dictionary easier to read and for you to find what you are looking for. The Oxford English Minidictionary has all the everyday words you need; there are over 90,000 words, phrases, and definitions packed between its covers. The new edition also features a 16-page centre supplement that provides quick-reference language tips (such as hints on remembering the correct spellings of commonly misspelled words), and handy word lists for word-games and puzzles.

The Trouble with Science

The Trouble with Science
Interest
In "The Trouble with Science," Robin Dunbar asks whether science really is unique to Western culture, even to humankind. He suggests that our "trouble with science"--our inability to grasp how it works, our suspiciousness of its successes--may lie in the fact that evolution has left our minds better able to cope with day-to-day social interaction than with the complexities of the external world.

Evolving the Mind: On the Nature of Matter and the Origin of Consciousness
by A.G. Cairns-Smith
 3.44  ·   Rating details ·  16 Ratings  ·  2 Reviews
Our minds must be considered among the wonders of the natural world. It seems hardly credible that an organised assemblage of molecules can generate vivid feelings and sensations, yet the brain is such an assemblage and it does...So, how does our conscious mind arise from our physical brain? Evolving the Mind examines this question by following two main themes: how theories of the mind have evolved in science and how the mind itself evolved in Nature. This book is written in a very accessible way. It is amusing, serious, informative and at times conversational. It starts in history and follows a trail for a physical theory of consciousness inadvertently laid down by twentieth century science. (less)

Collins Rhyming Dictionary

 4.5  ·   Rating details ·  8 Ratings  ·  1 Review
This is the most accessible resource for finding the perfect rhyme. Other rhyming dictionaries often use obscure words for padding, subsections for disyllabic and trisyllabic rhymes, and reverse phonetic order. This resource avoids such complications and, as a result, is the most practical rhyming book available. Clearly presented, it groups the most satisfactory rhymes—40,000 in all—taking both stress and vowel assonance into account. An index helps readers jump straight to the word they are looking for, and eye-catching panels offer examples of rhyme in action. (less)

This is a concise collection of practical and relevant data for anyone working on, or interested in, sound systems. Since the second edition, the Sony Mini Disc has arrived, interest has grown in valve amplifiers and vintage radios, and new safety regulations are in force for public address systems; all of these are covered in this edition. Also included are further notes on the crossover network, and the latest exciting developments in surround sound. The number of outdoor concerts is growing and place particular demands on sound systems, including the need for reinforcement. A new section gives basic tips. Surround sound developments are described in a further new section, outlining previous systems and how they worked, along with an account of how the ear actually distinguishes sound sources. This book should appeal to audio and hi-fi engineers, technicians and enthusiasts. (less)

About
Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper, is a folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression and triumphant reward. Thousands of variants are known throughout the world. The title character is a young woman living in unfortunate circumstances, that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune. The story of Rhodopis, recounted by the Greek geographer Strabo in around 7 BC, about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt, is usually considered as the earliest known variant of the "Cinderella" story. The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his Pentamerone in 1634; the most popular version was first published by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé in 1697, and later by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales in 1812.

The Colour Oxford English Dictionary

it was amazing 5.0  ·  Rating details ·  2 Ratings  ·  0 Reviews
This reissue of the second edition of the Colour Oxford English Dictionary is part of Oxford's new range of dictionaries derived from the highly-acclaimed New Oxford Dictionary of English. With a portable and durable format, it is an excellent all-purpose dictionary, although it is particularly suitable for schoolchildren, especially pre-GCSE and Standard Grade level, in the 11-14 age group. The emphasis is therefore on clarity and accessibility both in terms of layout and content. The bold and attractive new design, with all headwords, inflections, derivatives, and phrases in colour, makes it very easy to find the information you need, while definitions are written in clear and simple English, avoiding technical vocabulary. Extra help is provided in the shape of pronunciation for difficult vocabulary using a simple respelling system, in-text notes which give guidance on spelling, usage, and selected word origins, and boxes which cover general grammar points, such as punctuation, word building, and pronouns. This reissue published with a new jacket replaces the previous ISBN: 0-19-860375-4. (less)

Glinda of Oz
Glinda of Oz is the fourteenth Land of Oz book written by children's author L. Frank Baum, published on July 10, 1920. It is the last book of the original Oz series, which was later continued by other authors. Like most of the Oz books, the plot features a journey through some of the remoter regions of Oz; though in this case the pattern is doubled: Dorothy and Ozma travel to stop a war between the Flatheads and Skeezers; then Glinda and a cohort of Dorothy's friends set out to rescue them. The book was dedicated to Baum's second son, Robert Stanton Baum.

AboutThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman (Wizard of Oz): (L Frank Baum Masterpiece Collection)
Book
One was a Scarecrow. That means he was a suit of blue Munchkin clothes, stuffed with straw, on top of which was fastened a round cloth head, filled with bran to hold it in shape. On the head were painted two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth. The Scarecrow had never been much of a success in scaring crows, but he prided himself on being a superior man, because he could feel no pain, was never tired and did not have to eat or drink. His brains were sharp, for the Wizard of Oz had put pins and needles in the Scarecrow's brains. The other man was made all of tin, his arms and legs and head being cleverly jointed so that he could move them freely. He was known as the Tin Woodman, having at one time been a woodchopper, and everyone loved him because the Wizard had given him an excellent heart of red plush. The Tin Woodman lived in a magnificent tin castle, built on his country estate in the Winkie Land, not far from the Emerald City of Oz. It had pretty tin furniture and was surrounded by lovely gardens in which were many tin trees and beds of tin flowers. The palace of the Scarecrow was not far distant, on the banks of a river, and this palace was in the shape of an immense ear of corn.

Ozma and the Little Wizard (Wizard of Oz): (L Frank Baum Masterpiece Collection)
Interest
Once upon a time there lived in the beautiful Emerald City, which lies in the center of the fairy Land of Oz, a lovely girl called Princess Ozma, who was ruler of all that country. And among those who served this girlish Ruler and lived in a cozy suite of rooms in her splendid palace, was a little, withered old man known as the Wizard of Oz. This little Wizard could do a good many queer things in magic; but he was a kind man, with merry, twinkling eyes and a sweet smile; so, instead of fearing him because of his magic, everybody loved him. Now, Ozma was very anxious that all her people who inhabited the pleasant Land of Oz should be happy and contented, and therefore she decided one morning to make a journey to all parts of the country, that she might discover if anything was amiss, or anyone discontented, or if there was any wrong that ought to be righted. She asked the little Wizard to accompany her and he was glad to go. "Shall I take my bag of magic tools with me?" he asked.

Tiktok and the Nome King (Wizard of Oz): (L Frank Baum Masterpiece Collection)
Interest
The Nome King was unpleasantly angry. He had carelessly bitten his tongue at breakfast and it still hurt; so he roared and raved and stamped around in his underground palace in a way that rendered him very disagreeable. It so happened that on this unfortunate day Tiktok, the Clockwork Man, visited the Nome King to ask a favor. Tiktok lived in the Land of Oz, and although he was an active and important person, he was made entirely of metal. Machinery within him, something like the works of a clock, made him move; other machinery made him talk; still other machinery made him think. Although so cleverly constructed, the Clockwork Man was far from perfect. Three separate keys wound up his motion machinery, his speech works, and his thoughts. One or more of these contrivances was likely to run down at a critical moment, leaving poor Tiktok helpless. Also some of his parts were wearing out, through much use, and just now his thought machinery needed repair. The skillful little Wizard of Oz had tinkered with Tiktok's thoughts without being able to get them properly regulated, so he had advised the Clockwork Man to go to the Nome King and secure a new set of springs, which would render his thoughts more elastic and responsive.

Dorothy was a little Kansas girl who once accidentally found the beautiful Land of Oz and was invited to live there always. Toto was Dorothy's small black dog, with fuzzy, curly hair and bright black eyes. Together, when they tired of the grandeur of the Emerald City of Oz, they would wander out into the country and all through the land, peering into queer nooks and corners and having a good time in their own simple way. There was a little Wizard living in Oz who was a faithful friend of Dorothy and did not approve of her traveling alone in this way, but the girl always laughed at the little man's fears for her and said she was not afraid of anything that might happen.

About
The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby is a children's novel by the Reverend Charles Kingsley. Written in 1862–63 as a serial for Macmillan's Magazine, it was first published in its entirety in 1863. It was written as part satire in support of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species. The book was extremely popular in England, and was a mainstay of British children's literature for many decades, but eventually fell out of favour in part due to its prejudices (common at the time) against Irish, Jews, Americans, and the poor.

The Nutcracker of Nuremberg - Illustrated with Silhouettes Cut by Else Hasselriis
Book
This vintage book contains Alexandre Dumas s children s tale, The Nutcracker of Nuremberg . Based on the classic Christmas story by E. T. A. Hoffmann, it is the magical adventure of Marie Stahlbaum's favourite toy, the Nutcracker, who battles the nefarious Mouse King in battle and takes the reader on a wonderful adventure, into a magical land of dolls. Dumas s version was adapted by the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky into the famous ballet The Nutcracker . Contents include: "Part I: The Story of the Nutcracker of Nuremburg," "Part II: The Story of the Nut Krakatuk and the Princess Pirlipate," and Part III: The Story of Marie and the King of the Toys." Alexandre Dumas (1802 1870) was a famous French writer. He is best remembered for his exciting romantic sagas, including "The Three Musketeers" and "The Count of Monte Cristo." Despite making a great deal of money from his writing, Dumas was almost perpetually penniless thanks to his extravagant lifestyle. His novels have since been translated into nearly a hundred different languages, and have inspired over two hundred motion pictures. Many vintage texts such as this are becoming increasingly rare and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now, in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author."

About
Vom Kriege is a book on war and military strategy by Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz (1780–1831), written mostly after the Napoleonic wars, between 1816 and 1830, and published posthumously by his wife Marie von Brühl in 1832. It has been translated into English several times as On War. On War is actually an unfinished work; Clausewitz had set about revising his accumulated manuscripts in 1827, but did not live to finish the task. His wife edited his collected works and published them between 1832 and 1835. His 10-volume collected works contain most of his larger historical and theoretical writings, though not his shorter articles and papers or his extensive correspondence with important political, military, intellectual and cultural leaders in the Prussian state. On War is formed by the first three volumes and represents his theoretical explorations. It is one of the most important treatises on political-military analysis and strategy ever written, and remains both controversial and an influence on strategic thinking.
