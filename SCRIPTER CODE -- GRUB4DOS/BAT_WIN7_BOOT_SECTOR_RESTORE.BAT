@REM -- THURSDAY 02 JUNE 2K-ONE-SIX
@REM -- ---------------------------
@REM -- TODAY I UPDATE THIS BATCH FILE FOR 
@REM -- FIX BOOTSECTOR

@REM -- GOT NEW PC 

@REM -- ONE SINGLE DRIVE ABOUT 500GB

@REM -- MAKE BACKUP USING PARTISION WIZARD
@REM -- IN DISK COPY MODE
@REM -- SO ALL PARTITION ARE EXACT THAT IS ONLY WAY
@REM -- ON A NEW DRIVE CLEAN DRIVE IS ONLY WAY

@REM -- ON THE NEW SYSTEM I GOT
@REM -- HAD RECOVERY DISK
@REM -- DON@REM -- T USE THEM

@REM -- PROBLEM FOR RECOVERY
@REM -- BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY USE THAT ONE TO GET FACTORY WORKING AGAIN
@REM -- YOU NEW PC WILL COME WITH ADRIVER DISK 
@REM -- THAT IS OKAY FOR A WINODWS 7 10 INSTALL

@REM -- BUT MAY FIND TO BUY A NEW OPPERATING SYSTEM DISK BY LOOK OF IT

@REM -- THE FACTPRY RESTORE IS QUITE USELESS
@REM -- IT TAKE 3 DVD
@REM -- AND WINDOWS IS ONE

@REM -- THE DISK HAS TWO MODE ALMOST THE SAME - ONE FACTORY RESET ANOTHER SIMULAR ABOUT REPAIR

@REM -- NOT ANY RECOVERY TOOL

@REM -- NEXT IN PROBLEM
@REM -- AFTER BACKUP

@REM -- MY SYSTEM I DELETE THE PARTION CALL OTHER ONE UP FROM 
@REM -- AFTER EFI BOOT PARTION 

@REM -- I KNOW THE -*OTHER*- PARTITION CAN BE REMOVED
@REM -- WITHOUT EFFECTING ANYTHING
  
@REM -- PROBLEM WAS I WANTED GRUB4DOS ON THE SYSTEM

@REM -- AND USE IN VERBOSE MODE WITH GRUB-INSTALL PROGRAM
@REM -- IT COMPLAIN ABOUT ERROR ON DRIVE WHEN ATTEPT SOMETHING TO DO WITH OTHER AS TYPE OF PARTICAION NOT RECOGNIZED

@REM -- THAT WHY I REMOVE OTHER

@REM -- GETTING ON NEXT BIT

@REM -- I NOTICE THE PARTION ARE IN GTI TYPE USE
@REM -- AND I FOUND NONE PARTITION ON DRIVE CAN DO THE USUAL 
@REM -- PRIMARY AND LOGICAL THING

@REM -- A LOOK AROUND PARTIION WIZARD
@REM -- BECUASE I WAS ABOUT TO COPY A PARTION TO ANOTHER DRIVE 
@REM -- SO THAT WOULD ASK DO YOU WANT TO CREATE COPY AS LOGICAL OR PRIMARY

@REM -- BUT UNDER DISK TOP MENU I FOUND CONVERT
@REM -- GTI TO NORMAL LOGICA PRIMARY

@REM -- USE THAT QUICK

@REM -- STILL PROBLEM WITH TRY TO BOOT

@REM -- A NORMAL WIN 7 INSTALL DISK ONA PEN DRIVE
@REM -- WON@REM -- T RECOGNIZE MY WINDOWS 7 PRO 
@REM -- POSIABLE BECUASE A FACTORY VERION OR EFI OF GTI 
@REM -- IT KNEW WAS THERE BUT WOULD NOT WORK WITH IT

@REM -- BUT WIN 10 INSTALL SETUP DISK IN 32 BIT 64 BIT MODE ALL IN ONE
@REM -- THAT IS OKAY

@REM -- BUT LATER FOUND 
@REM -- ONLY OKAY IF THE SYSTEM HASA WINDOWS SETUP OKAY

@REM -- BECAUSE I LOST THE BCD
@REM -- AND THEN NOT WORK

@REM -- AND THEN FOUND WIN 7 SETUP WAS THEN OKAY
@REM -- AND THEN I GET TO RECOVERY COMMAND RPOMPT

@REM -- ALSO BEFORE I TESTED RECREATE THE BCD LOCATION STORE ONTO THE C DRIVE OS SYS FOLDER
@REM -- RATHER THAN THE EFI PARTION
@REM -- BUT THAT WAS WITH USE THE
@REM -- DISKPART METHOD
@REM -- WHICH I FIND BETTER WHEN THE DRIVE IS A SSD BECUASE THE SSD IS ON DRIVE 1 2ND AFTER DRIVE 0 AND DRIVE 0 BEING THE BIG 2ND DATA DRIVE D DRIVE

@REM -- YES SO RECREATE BCD NEW LOCATION OF OS C CDRVE RATHER THAN EFI PART 
@REM -- WAS GOOD TO BOOT IN AS TEST

@REM -- AND THEN AFTER DELETE THE *OTHER* PARTION
@REM -- STILL GRUB4DOS NOT INSTALL

@REM -- SO TIME TRY DELETE EFI PARTION

@REM -- AND WITH EFI GONE ALSO THE RECOVERY PARTION IS NOT ANY USE GOOD BYE GONE
@REM -- BUT KEEP A BACKUP FOR EASY REPLACE FROM A DRIVE IF EVER SELL THE MACHINE
@REM -- GUESS EASYIER THAN RECOVERY TOOL
@REM -- BUT MAY USE A LOT OF MY SETTING BY THEN

@REM -- TIME A BUY A WINDOWS OS
@REM -- OR TRY THE ROBOT TELEPHONE TO GET A SERIAL OUT OF THEM

@REM -- AND PRO VERSION IS DOUBLE PRICE AT £200 MAYBE WIN 7 OR WIN 10

@REM -- NEXT INFO

@REM -- CLEANED DRIVE 
@REM -- BACK TO PRIMARY AND LOGICAL USE

@REM -- MANY TYPE LOWER CASE BUT DON@REM -- T MATTER

@REM -- EXTRA COMMAND SOME DON@REM -- T USE IS
@REM -- THING TO WRITE BAT FILE IN EDITOR 
@REM -- IS THESE COMMAND ONLY ARE IN THE RECOVERY COMMAND PROMPT
@REM -- TO TEST WAY WORK
