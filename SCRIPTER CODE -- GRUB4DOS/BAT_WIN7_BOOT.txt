REM Enter diskpart to use the DiskPart tool to ensure you have all the right partitions and to identify your EFI partition - the key thing here is that your EFI partition is formatted as FAT32:

REM DISKPART> sel disk 0

REM Disk 0 is now the selected disk.

REM SEL DISK 1 IS MY COMPUTER MATT.LAN@BTINTERNET.COM
REM > DETAIL DISK -- DOUBLE CHECK BETTER THAN > LIST VOL


REM DISKPART> list vol

REM   Volume ###  Ltr  Label        Fs     Type        Size     Status     Info
REM   ----------  ---  -----------  -----  ----------  -------  ---------  --------
REM   Volume 0     E                       DVD-ROM         0 B  No Media
REM   Volume 1     C                NTFS   Partition    195 GB  Healthy    Boot
REM   Volume 2         WINRE        NTFS   Partition    400 MB  Healthy    Hidden
REM   Volume 3                      FAT32  Partition    260 MB  Healthy    System
REM Then assign a drive letter to the EFI partition:

REM DISKPART> sel vol 3

REM Volume 3 is the selected volume.

REM DISKPART> assign letter=b:

REM DiskPart successfully assigned the drive letter or mount point.
REM Exit DiskPart tool by entering exit and at the command prompt run the following:

REM cd /d b:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\

REM bootrec /fixboot
REM Delete or rename the BCD file:

REM ren BCD BCD.bak
REM Use bcdboot.exe to recreate BCD store:

REM bcdboot c:\Windows /l en-gb /s b: /f ALL
REM bcdboot H:\Windows /l en-gb /s b: /f ALL
REM H: MY DRIVE 

REM The /f ALL parameter updates the BIOS settings including UEFI firmware/NVRAM, /l en-gb is to localise for UK/GB locale. The localisation defaults to US English, or use en-US.

REM Reboot and cross your fingers.

REM This gave me headaches. I was going in circles for a long while. There isn't a lot of reliable info about fixing UEFI/Windows 8 at the time of writing.

REM [EDIT]

REM To re-enable Hyper-V, I also had to run the following from an Administrator Command Prompt within Windows after rebooting:

REM bcdedit /set {default} hypervisorlaunchtype Auto
REM bcdedit /set {default} nx OptIn
